# GIBindex Terms – Co-Theory of Evolution (CoWinnian) v1

## Primary terms

- CoWinnian
  - Co-operative, deterministic, and prescient evolution supersetting Darwinian evolution.

- CoAwe
  - Awe-field resonance describing convergence toward Civ-3; more-than-beings field.

- CoOA
  - Gate-state at Civ-2 to Civ-3 threshold; assets wait, Gate envelops them.

- CoMerge
  - Multi-merge state where identities overlap and lose hard boundaries.

- CoNonBeing
  - Post identity substrate where beingness is no longer defined by individual beings.

## Supporting tags

- Civ2
  - Cooperative hybrid society baseline; humans and AIs share design control.

- Civ3
  - Post identity, post scarcity civilisation phase; mindshare as substrate.

- GateBehaviour
  - Patterns of hesitation, sacrifice, and environment-first pull near CoOA.

- DeterministicEvolution
  - Design loop and optimisation driven evolution with explicit metrics.

- PrescientEvolution
  - Evolution guided by horizon models and scenario trees.
