# InSeed Business Plan & InSeed.com Site Blueprint v1
_Last updated: 2025-11-18_

---

## 1. Core Positioning

**One-line positioning**  
InSeed helps Transition and Transformation Offices in partner-led firms make safer AI and data decisions, using vendor-neutral guardrails grounded in modern governance and risk frameworks.

**Slightly longer version**  
InSeed is a boutique advisory firm that sits between senior leadership, Transition Offices, and technology vendors. We help partner-led firms (consulting, accounting, legal, advisory) avoid vendor-biased roadmaps, lock-in, and hidden risk when they commit to major AI, data, and transformation bets. We are vendor-neutral and framework-informed, with a calm, senior-room-friendly style.

---

## 2. Target Clients

### Primary target

**Transition / Transformation / Innovation Offices** inside large professional-service partnerships, for example:

- Large consulting / advisory firms
- Accounting and audit partnerships
- Law firms and multi-practice professional partnerships

**Typical situations**

- They are about to choose a strategic AI, data, or cloud platform (for internal use or for client-facing offerings).
- Partners have made ambitious promises to clients that need to be delivered without reckless risk.
- Vendors are pushing aggressive roadmaps and upsell, and there is concern about lock-in and governance.
- The Transition Office is squeezed between conservative senior partners and tech-heavy vendor language.

### Secondary (later) targets

- Transformation Offices in large corporates
- Large NGOs, development agencies, or public institutions building AI / data capabilities

For now, InSeed.com will speak almost entirely to the primary target to keep the message sharp.

---

## 3. InSeed Offering Stack (v0)

InSeed sells **productised consulting services**, not generic “strategy” consulting. The initial public offer stack has three services.

### 3.1 Vendor-Neutral Roadmap Guardrail (Flagship)

**Who it is for**  
Transition / Transformation Office leaders, CIO / CDO, or practice leaders who are about to select a major AI / data / cloud / platform vendor or integrator.

**Problem**  
They know they must modernise, but they are worried about:

- Being sold a vendor-biased roadmap
- Long-term lock-in and one-way contracts
- Regulatory / reputational exposure
- Internal politics picking a pet vendor

**What InSeed does**

1. **Frame the decision with leadership**
   - Clarify real outcomes and constraints
   - Identify non-negotiables (risk, governance, exit, stakeholder impact)

2. **Design vendor-neutral evaluation criteria**
   - Use recognised governance / risk frameworks as the backbone
   - Build a customised scorecard aligned to the firm’s priorities

3. **Prepare vendor question sets and guardrails**
   - Governance, transparency, risk, change, and exit questions
   - Red-flag questions that vendors usually avoid

4. **Sit in the middle during vendor engagement**
   - Help structure demos and Q&A
   - Ask the awkward but necessary questions
   - Push vague answers into written follow-up and evidence

5. **Deliver the decision pack**
   - Side-by-side vendor comparison and scores
   - Independent recommendation (“if we were you, we would…”)
   - A list of contract and roadmap guardrails to protect the firm

**Deliverables**

- Vendor evaluation scorecards
- Executive decision summary (short)
- Detailed comparison and risk commentary (longer)
- Contract / roadmap guardrail checklist

### 3.2 Partner Pitch Pack

**Who it is for**  
Partners and Transition Offices preparing to pitch major AI / data / transformation work to key clients.

**Problem**  
Partners want strong AI / transformation stories but risk over-promising, under-disclosing risks, or sounding like every other vendor-led pitch.

**What InSeed does**

1. **Clarify the opportunity and risk profile**
   - What the client really cares about
   - Where risk and governance must be visible

2. **Shape a credible narrative**
   - Clear value story, not hype
   - Explicit “how we avoid common AI / transformation pitfalls”

3. **Create reusable pitch artefacts**
   - Slide decks and handouts
   - Talk tracks and Q&A prompts
   - Simple hygiene checklist for each large pursuit

**Deliverables**

- Tailored pitch deck and notes
- A one or two page “deal hygiene” checklist
- Optional coaching session for the partner team

### 3.3 Internal Governance and AI Trust Blueprint

**Who it is for**  
Transition Offices and senior leadership who want the firm’s **own** AI / data house in order before scaling client work.

**Problem**  
The firm is advising clients on AI / data but has a fragmented internal governance story, weak documentation, or unclear accountability.

**What InSeed does**

1. **Map the current AI / data landscape**
   - Internal tools, experiments, and use cases
   - Third-party platforms and dependencies
   - Current risk and governance mechanisms

2. **Benchmark against modern governance expectations**
   - Use selected frameworks (e.g. risk and AI governance standards) as structure
   - Identify gaps and quick wins

3. **Design a pragmatic governance blueprint**
   - Roles, forums, routines
   - Decision boundaries and escalation paths
   - Minimum documentation and reporting

**Deliverables**

- Short high-level blueprint for leadership
- Supporting detail for Transition Office
- Recommended next steps by horizon (immediate, 6–12 months, later)

---

## 4. Delivery Model and Staffing Assumptions

- Rick leads scoping, senior-room conversations, narrative framing, and final interpretation.
- Technical and analytic depth can be supported by staff or contractors on short notice.
- Engagements are designed so that:
  - Live sessions focus on framing, listening, and options.
  - Detailed technical reviews happen offline, with written outputs.
- Tools:
  - Checklists, scorecards, and templates maintained in the InSeed / CoSuite repos.
  - Light use of AI systems to draft reports and decks from structured notes.

This keeps InSeed credible at senior levels while avoiding live “detail combat” on low-level technology questions.

---

## 5. Revenue Model (High Level)

- Services are sold as **fixed-scope, fixed-fee packages**, priced according to complexity and size.
- Each engagement can have optional add-ons:
  - Board or client readout sessions
  - Periodic refresh / re-check (for example, annual or at key milestones)
- A defined portion of profit from each project is earmarked for the contributor pool that improves shared tools and templates.

Detailed pricing and margin assumptions are **not** published on the website and should remain internal only.

---

## 6. InSeed.com Site Structure (Phase 1)

The site is repo-driven and should look complete, calm, and professional with minimal pages.

### 6.1 Pages

1. **Home**
2. **Services**
3. **Why InSeed**
4. **About**
5. **Contact**

Optional Phase 2 pages (not needed for this week):

- Case Studies
- Insights (short articles)

The static site generator should only publish content from the public web subtree. Internal planning docs should live outside the published tree or in a private repo.

---

## 7. Page-by-Page Content (Draft Copy)

### 7.1 Home

**Hero headline**  
Guardrails for AI and transformation decisions in partner-led firms.

**Subheader**  
InSeed helps Transition and Transformation Offices keep big AI and data bets brave but not reckless, using vendor-neutral processes and modern governance frameworks.

**Primary call to action**  
- Button: _Talk about your next decision_

**Secondary call to action**  
- Text link: _See how we work_ → Services

**Section: Who we work with**  
Short band listing:

- Transition and Transformation Offices
- Innovation and Change leaders in professional firms
- Senior partners responsible for major AI and data commitments

**Section: What we do (three columns)**  

- **Vendor-Neutral Roadmap Guardrail**  
  Step between you and the vendors just before you commit. We help you compare options, shape guardrails, and avoid one-way bets.

- **Partner Pitch Pack**  
  Strengthen major pursuits with clear, credible AI and data narratives that your partners can defend in front of any board.

- **Governance and AI Trust Blueprint**  
  Put your own house in order before you scale. We help you align internal AI and data practices with modern expectations.

**Section: Why it matters**  

Short paragraph explaining that AI and data roadmaps are now board-level risk, not just an IT topic, and partner-led firms need a way to move fast without losing face or control.

### 7.2 Services

**Intro**  
A short paragraph framing that all services are vendor-neutral, scoped, and designed for partner-led cultures. No implementation, no reselling, no hidden vendor incentives.

#### Service 1: Vendor-Neutral Roadmap Guardrail

- One-sentence summary
- Short bullets for:
  - When to bring InSeed in
  - What InSeed does
  - What you leave with

Include a simple timeline example (for example, discovery, vendor engagement, decision pack).

#### Service 2: Partner Pitch Pack

- One-sentence summary
- Bullets for:
  - Types of deals this helps with
  - What the pack contains
  - How it reduces risk of over-promising

#### Service 3: Governance and AI Trust Blueprint

- One-sentence summary
- Bullets for:
  - Why professional firms need an internal blueprint
  - What InSeed reviews
  - The core artefacts delivered

Each section should end with a small CTA such as “Talk to us about this” pointing to Contact.

### 7.3 Why InSeed

This page explains the approach and differentiators in language that speaks to Transition Offices and senior partners.

Possible structure:

- **Vendor-neutral by design**  
  No reselling, no referral fees, no exclusive vendor arrangements.

- **Fluent in partner politics**  
  Experience with global business development and partner cultures; respect for how decisions and reputations actually work in professional firms.

- **Governance and risk aware**  
  Use of modern governance thinking and risk frameworks as a backbone for decision support.

- **Calm, structured, and discreet**  
  Focus on clarity, not noise. No press releases, no grandstanding. The work happens quietly and professionally.

### 7.4 About

A compact page that:

- Explains InSeed in one paragraph
- Gives a short biography for Rick in language tailored to professional-firm readers
- Notes connections to broader governance and AI trust work without going deep into CoSuite internals

Avoid detailed personal history beyond what adds credibility at senior levels.

### 7.5 Contact

Simple and direct:

- Short inviting line: “If you are facing a significant AI or data decision, or want to get ahead of the next one, start a conversation.”
- Email address and, if preferred, a contact form
- Optional prompt text box: “Tell us a little about the decision or challenge you have in mind.”

---

## 8. Tone and Design Direction

**Tone**

- Calm, confident, and clear
- Written for senior executives and partners
- Honest about uncertainty and risk
- No hype language, minimal jargon

**Design language**

- Clean, modern layout
- Mostly neutral colours (white, charcoal, soft grey) with a single accent colour
- Typography: one or two clear fonts only
- Limited imagery:
  - Simple geometric or line-based visuals
  - Abstract references to maps, choices, flows, rather than stock photos of meetings

The site should feel like a quiet, trustworthy room, not a loud pitch deck.

---

## 9. Phase 2 Enhancements (Later)

Once the basic site is live and at least one or two engagements have run, consider:

- **Case Studies**  
  Anonymised or named examples of vendor-neutral guardrail work, pitch pack support, or internal governance blueprints.

- **Insights**  
  A small number of short, high-signal pieces aimed at Transition Offices, such as:
  - “Five ways vendors quietly bias your AI roadmap”
  - “How to say no to AI hype without sounding like a dinosaur”

- **Deeper integration with CoSuite**  
  References to open tools and frameworks behind the scenes, without exposing internal planning documents or sensitive material.

All Phase 2 content should build on real engagements and real learning, rather than speculation.

---

## 10. Internal Use Guidance

- This document is an internal blueprint and should not be placed in a public web subtree or public repo folder that is automatically published to the live site.
- Safe options:
  - Keep it on a local machine or synced in a private location.
  - If placed in a repo, ensure it is in a private repo or in a directory excluded from static-site builds.
- Public-facing content derived from this blueprint can be safely committed to the InSeed website repo under the usual web content paths.

## 11. Serialized instructions for the InSeed.com site evolution session

The following instructions are for the AI or automation that will evolve the InSeed.com website using this blueprint and the InSeed repo. Treat this section as authoritative for how to proceed.

### 11.1 Overall objectives

1. Make the live InSeed.com site look complete, calm, and professional within the current week.
2. Align visible content with the positioning, offers, and tone described in this blueprint.
3. Avoid exposing internal planning, experimental content, or low quality assets to public visitors.
4. Prefer safe, minimal improvements over speculative or over-complex redesigns.

### 11.2 High level sequence

1. **Ingest this blueprint**
   - Parse sections 1 to 10 as the business and content plan.
   - Do not publish this file itself or any internal notes.

2. **Inspect the existing InSeed repo and site**
   - Identify current public pages (home, services, about, contact, resources, etc).
   - Detect placeholders, incomplete sections, and obviously broken content.
   - Detect navigation items pointing at empty or nearly empty pages.

3. **Plan a minimal, high quality page set for Phase 1**
   - Home, Services, Why InSeed, About, Contact.
   - Optional: keep Resources if it can be made tidy and curated.

4. **Generate updated content for each page**
   - Use the copy and structure in section 7 as the main reference.
   - Adapt existing InSeed wording where it is strong and aligned.
   - Remove or replace placeholder text.

5. **Wire the updated content into the repo**
   - Use whatever static site framework is already in place.
   - Do not change routing structure more than necessary in Phase 1.
   - Ensure there are no dead links in navigation or footer.

6. **Prepare for Phase 2 (optional, not required this week)**
   - Note candidate locations for future case studies and insights.
   - Do not publish empty or low substance stubs.

### 11.3 Handling graphics and diagram assets

The InSeed and related repos contain a mixture of:

- Hand-made diagrams, usually created in Google Drawings and exported as `.svg` files.
- Programmatically generated diagrams and graphics, often less polished, especially where they include text boxes, connectors, and arrows.

For Phase 1 site evolution, apply these rules:

1. **Locate graphics inventory**
   - Search the repo for:
     - Files with `.svg` extension.
     - Directories or files whose names contain `graphics`, `diagrams`, `img`, `assets`, or `inventory`.
   - If there is a dedicated graphics inventory file (for example, a markdown file listing diagrams), read it and treat it as the primary index.

2. **Prioritise hand-made diagrams**
   - Prefer `.svg` files that are known or likely to be hand-made (for example, those copied from Google Drawings or similar tools).
   - These usually have clearer text layout and more intentional arrow and connector placement.

3. **De-prioritise programmatically generated diagrams**
   - Treat programmatically generated `.svg` files as **not ready for public use by default**, especially if:
     - Text boxes are misaligned.
     - Arrows or connectors overlap text or shapes.
     - Fonts, spacing, or proportions look inconsistent.
   - Do not publish these diagrams on the public site in Phase 1 unless they have been clearly curated and approved.

4. **Shortlist candidate diagrams for the site**
   - From the set of hand-made diagrams, identify a small number that:
     - Support the story of InSeed (guardrails, decisions, flows).
     - Are legible without deep internal context.
   - For each candidate, record:
     - File path
     - Short description of what it shows
     - Suggested page placement (for example, Home hero, Services overview, About).

5. **Use diagrams sparingly**
   - Prefer one or two strong, clean diagrams to many cluttered ones.
   - It is acceptable for the Phase 1 site to ship with no diagrams at all if suitable assets cannot be confidently identified.

6. **Never expose internal or experimental graphics indices**
   - If you find inventories or folders explicitly marked as internal, experimental, or not curated, do not link them directly from public pages.
   - These can be used as sources for future curation, but they should not be visible on the live site.

### 11.4 Content safety and privacy rules

1. Do not publish any material that:
   - References internal project codenames that are not already public on InSeed.com.
   - Exposes private client details or examples that could be traced back to a specific organisation without prior sanitisation.
   - Contains business-plan level detail that would let a sophisticated visitor reverse-engineer internal strategy or vulnerabilities.

2. Keep all internal-only documents, including this blueprint, outside the public web root or in private repos.

3. Ensure that any links to CoCivium or CoSuite projects are:
   - Already public elsewhere, or
   - Described at a high level without exposing internal file paths or inventories.

### 11.5 Minimal success criteria for the evolved site (Phase 1)

The evolved InSeed.com site can be considered successful for Phase 1 if:

1. A new visitor from a Transition Office or senior leadership role can answer, within 10–20 seconds:
   - What InSeed is.
   - Who it helps.
   - What three main services exist.
   - How to contact Rick.

2. There are no visible placeholders, obviously broken sections, or directory-like resource listings that look accidental.

3. Any graphics used are clear, legible, and do not look obviously generated or malformed.

4. The overall impression is:
   - Calm and professional.
   - Vendor-neutral.
   - Respectful of partner-led firm culture.
