# Co1 Mobile Session Sweep Advisory
*Preventing loss of intent from prior mobile-only sessions*

## 1. Context

Many advisory ideas, metaphors, and proto-patterns were discussed in **mobile ChatGPT sessions** where PS7 / CLI access was not available. Some of those sessions produced explicit `.md` deliverables; others ended with the intent to "make a deliverable later" without it ever being created.

This file suggests a **retrospective sweep strategy** Co1 can optionally use to reduce the risk that important mobile-only intent remains off-repo or half-captured.

## 2. Known session labels and themes

The following session labels and themes were mentioned in adjacent work and may have corresponding assets or important ideas:

- `CoWinnian`  -  discussions about new kinds of intentional, collaborative evolution.  
- `CoCivia20251118`  -  CoCivia mythos, CoTrove, communication strategies, insight pairs.  
- `Identity`  -  emotive narrative assets around system identity and human stories.  
- `Darwinian` / CoEthics-related discussions  -  maps for media/commerce ethics and influence.  
- `Products look feel`  -  design language evolution for CoSuite products.  
- `CoTrove`  -  naming and structure for collections of wisdom snippets.  
- `CoBreak` / `CoBeacon`  -  conceptual GIBindex entries and deliverables for guardrails and AI/human-facing websites.  
- `CoNudge`  -  patterns for user preference reinforcement via repeated prompts.  
- Various “Co1 advice” conversations about canonicality, CoCache inbox usage, and AdviceBomb handling.

Not all of these will have `.md` assets already. Some may exist as AdviceBomb zips; others may only live in prior transcripts or partial notes.

## 3. Suggested sweep strategy

Co1 may:

1. **Search existing repos** (e.g. `CoCivium`, `CoCache`, `CoSteward`, `CoAgent`, `CoArena`, `CoEthics`, `RickPublic`) for mentions of:

   - `CoWinnian`, `CoCivia`, `CoTrove`, `CoBeacon`, `CoBreak`, `CoNudge`, `CoPrime`  
   - session labels like `CoCivia20251118`, `Identity`, `Darwinian`, `Products look feel`

2. **Check advice/inbox and AdviceBomb-related folders** for:
   - `AdviceBomb_*.zip` files that may correspond to those sessions.  
   - `.sha256` receipts and `INBOX_LOG.md` entries that show ingestion status.

3. **Identify gaps**, e.g.:
   - Concepts heavily referenced in dialogue but lightly represented in repos.  
   - Narrative or mythos pieces that exist only as scattered text.  
   - Governance or ethical patterns that exist as “good ideas” but lack concrete implementation.

4. **For high-value gaps**, Co1 may:
   - Create concise `.md` advisories that summarise the concept and its intended role.  
   - Attach them to the appropriate repos via PRs.  
   - Optionally create CoTrove-style insight entries for reusable wisdom fragments.  
   - Update any CoPrime / CoAudit / CoCore mappings that need to know about these concepts.

## 4. Interaction with `Drop_For_Co1`

As the human CoSteward downloads and adds new `.md` assets (like this one) into `Drop_For_Co1`, Co1 can:

- Treat these as **hints about where blind spots may exist**.  
- Use them as starting points for deeper sweeps through repos and AdviceBomb histories.  
- Prioritise sweeps around concepts that seem central to governance, messaging, or CoSuite architecture.

## 5. Intent Summary

This advisory aims to:

- Reduce the chance that important mobile-only discussions are lost.  
- Encourage Co1 to perform targeted, concept-driven sweeps across repos and AdviceBombs.  
- Provide a light list of session labels and concept names that may deserve extra attention.  
- Support Co1 in building a more complete and coherent picture of the CoSuite’s evolving intent.

As always, Co1 may adopt, adapt, or ignore these suggestions depending on its own broader perspective.
