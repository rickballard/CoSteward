# CoGovernance Framework
## CoCivium Governance Architecture

### Purpose
Describe the decision system that governs CoSuite evolution, power distribution, and accountability.

### Roles
- **CoSteward** (primary during seed-stage)  
- **CoPrime** (orchestrator & verifier)

- **Edge contributors** (public contributors)  

### Decision Principles
- Transparency  
- Logs over memory  
- Repo-first authority  
- Canonicality protection  
- No concentration of unreviewed power  

### Process
