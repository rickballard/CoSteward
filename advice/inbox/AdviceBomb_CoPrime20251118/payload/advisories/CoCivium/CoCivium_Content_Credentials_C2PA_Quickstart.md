# Content Credentials Quickstart

Goal: attach provenance to images and PDFs so the public can verify origin.

Steps
1. Select a C2PA aware tool that can embed credentials into PNG, JPG, PDF.
2. Set the organization name and public URL for keys and verification.
3. Embed a link to the signed claim or release page.
4. Test extraction with at least two independent verifiers.
5. Publish images with a "Verify" link next to them.
