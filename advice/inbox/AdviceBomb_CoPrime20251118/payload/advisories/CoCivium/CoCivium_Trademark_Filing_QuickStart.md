# CoCivium Trademark Filing QuickStart - Canada first

## Next
- Logo filing: file design mark when budget permits
- Class 9: file additional word mark for downloadable software later
- US mirror: within 6 months, file word mark in Class 42 at the USPTO
- Madrid option: after Canada or US filing, consider EU, UK, AU via Madrid

## Status hygiene
