## Overview
CoDialogue defines the dialogue-governance layer for CoSuite, enabling structured preference management, CoEvolution support, reasoning-quality reflection, and adaptive workflows.

## Components
### 1. CoNudge Engine
- Detects emerging human preferences.
- Surfaces them for approval.
- Converts approved patterns into presets.

### 2. Reality Grade
- Scores message-level reasoning across seven metrics.
- Supports reflective, non-judgmental self-improvement.

### 3. Bar Chart Feedback
- Visual interface summarizing Reality Grade scores.

### 4. CoEvolution Guardrail

- Preserves user intent while improving epistemic integrity.

### 5. Dialogue Profile Schema

### 6. Integration with CoPrime

## Philosophy

- No crowns, no coercion, no corruption.
- Evolution over enforcement.
