# CoSteward Advisory: Hybrid Minds and Decision Architecture

## Purpose
Define how human plus AI cognition forms a superior decision engine for CoCivium work. Provide a clear model for how CoStewards should delegate, pair, and collaborate.

## Core Insight
No single intelligence is enough. A hybrid mind can escape limitations that trap individuals. The Steward role is to integrate these strengths.

## Human Strengths
- Intuition
- Embodiment
- Emotional foresight
- Moral instinct
- Pattern fluency under pressure

## AI Strengths
- Scale
- Consistency
- Logic
- Recall
- Exhaustive scenario analysis

## Hybrid Mind Principles

### Input Divergence
Start with both viewpoints. Never collapse early. The difference between human and AI perception is valuable signal.

### Asymmetric Strength Use
Route each task to the component best suited to it. Emotions to humans. Logic to AI. Ethics to joint review.

### Error Balancing
Humans and AIs have opposite failure modes. Cross checking cancels errors and improves trust.

### Shared Memory Trail
Record decisions in public repos so future Stewards inherit the reasoning chain.

## Steward Directives

1. Never decide alone. Pair at minimum with CoAgent or Co1.
2. Run complex topics through a minimum of two minds.
3. Involve additional Stewards when blind spots are suspected.
4. Maintain clean commit trails as extensions of hybrid memory.
5. Encourage CoNudge patterns so the system aligns over time.

## Expected Results
Better accuracy. Better foresight. Smoother CoEvolution. Lower chaos and lower risk of drift or collapse.
