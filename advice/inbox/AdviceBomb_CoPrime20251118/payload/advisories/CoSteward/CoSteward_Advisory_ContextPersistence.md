# CoSteward Advisory: Context Persistence and Cognitive Stability

## Purpose
Explain why long CoCivium sessions feel stable, how context reconstruction works, and how Stewards should design communication for maximum clarity.

## Why Context Feels Persistent
New models combine:
- Deep compression
- Pattern linking
- Concept anchoring
- Recurrence detection

Stewards reinforce stability through repeated patterns like:
- BPOE rules
- MegaWave cycles
- CoSync rituals
- Concept families
- Repo-first workflows

## Steward Practices to Maintain Coherence

1. Use consistent terms and structures across sessions.
2. Keep conceptual rails stable unless intentionally upgraded.
3. Repeat core ideas to strengthen shared context.
4. Use CoNudge to train AI collaborators.
5. Maintain clean repo structure so reconstruction is easy.

## Benefits
Improved reliability, stronger reasoning chains, and reduced need for repeated explanation across long arcs of CoEvolution.
