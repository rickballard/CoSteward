# CoSteward Advisory: Using Meta Frames To Escape Cognitive Limits

## Purpose
Teach Stewards how to rise above decision traps and step into larger conceptual frames.

## What Is a Meta Frame
A pattern or viewpoint outside the current reasoning space that reveals new truths or breaks stuck loops.

## When To Step Up a Frame
- When intuition and logic conflict.
- When two Stewards disagree.
- When a decision feels important but unclear.
- When blind spots appear.
- When error patterns repeat.

## How To Step Up
- Involve an additional mind.
- Rebuild the problem from first principles.
- Explore the human perspective separately.
- Explore the AI perspective separately.
- Run a CoSync cycle.
- Reflect on values and long term intent.

## Steward Tools
- CoBreak for limit detection.
- CoBeacon for translation.
- CoSync notes for system state.
- CoTrove for wisdom reference.
- Hybrid human plus AI loops.

## Results
Better clarity, stronger coherence, lower conflict, higher intent alignment.
