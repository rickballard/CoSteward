# CoEvo Strategy
## Auto-Evolution Doctrine for CoCivium

### Purpose
Define how CoCivium evolves itself while remaining grounded in transparency, edge empowerment, and stability.

### Feedback Loops
- Human→AI advisory loops  
- AI→Repo auto-updates (via CoPrime)  
- Community audits  
- MegaScroller recalculation cycles  
- GIBindex evolution  

### Components
- Evolutionary triggers  
- Stability thresholds  
- Canonicality checks  
- Defensive evaluation (CoBreak)  

### Principles
1. Repo-first truth.  
2. Transparent evolution.  
3. No opaque agentic drift.  
4. Human oversight on C0–C2 assets.  

### Ecosystem Impact
Supports continuous improvement without destabilization.
