# CoEvo Theory Sweep  -  Theory v2 (Expanded)

## Purpose
A comprehensive theoretical foundation for enabling AI–human co-evolution, semi-autonomous system evolution, and intent-aligned recursive improvement across the entire CoSuite.

## Evolutionary Principles
- **Directional Evolution**: Systems evolve toward higher alignment, capability, and coherence.
- **Intent Vectors**: Machine-readable directional markers guiding all evolution.
- **Constraint-Bounded Autonomy**: Evolution is permitted only within defined guardrails.
- **Edge Ownership**: Evolutionary authority belongs to the user-edge, not centralized cores.
- **Co-Symbiosis**: Human intuition and AI pattern synthesis reinforce each other.

## Knowledge Sources
- Evolutionary algorithms
- Genetic programming
- Multi-agent co-evolution
- Alignment research
- Distributed cognition models
- Open-source governance patterns

## Leverage Points
1. **Intent Formalization**
2. **Cross-module signal propagation**
3. **Auto-triage and advisory synthesis**
4. **Self-auditing via CoAudit patterns**
5. **Evolutionary pressure shaping**
6. **Recursive internal benchmarking**

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Local Minima**
  - Introduce stochastic exploration
  - Maintain multi-path proposals
- **Drift from Human Intent**
  - Dual consent via human + AI checkpoints
  - Require intent vector scoring before PR creation
- **Over-Coupling Modules**
  - Enforce CoSuite modularity standards
  - Maintain domain boundaries and explicit APIs

## Recommendations
- Maintain active evolution maps
- Ensure transparency of every auto-generated change
- Require provenance tagging and alignment scoring
- Run alignment sweeps on each evolution cycle
