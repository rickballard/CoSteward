# CoEvo Theory Sweep  -  Theory Draft

## Purpose
Foundational guidance for enabling AI–human co-evolution and semi-autonomous system evolution within the CoSuite.

## Core Concepts
- Evolutionary algorithms as inspiration
- Intent vectors as alignment scaffolds
- Recursive self-improvement with guardrails
- Edge-owned governance patterns
- AI–human symbiosis as a design principle

## Leverage Points
- Automated analysis of repo histories and patterns
- Self-generated advisories and triage recommendations
- Auto-discovery of best practices, benchmarks, and workflows

## Risks
- Overfitting to local minima
- Silent divergence from human intent
- Coordination failures across modules

## Recommendations
- Maintain explicit, machine-readable intent rails
- Require dual-channel validation (AI + human)
- Continuous alignment sweeps
