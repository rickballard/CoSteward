# CoEvo Theory Sweep  -  Implementation Draft

## Quickstart
This guide provides actionable steps for Co1/CoPrime20251118 to begin implementing semi-autonomous evolution.

## Framework
1. **Intent Extraction Module**
   - Parse advisories, commits, docs into structured intent.
2. **Auto-Improvement Loop**
   - Generate improvement proposals.
   - Test in sandboxes.
   - Submit PRs with rationale.
3. **CoEvolution Engine**
   - Cross-pollinate insights across repos.
   - Maintain versioned evolution maps.

## BPOE Integration
- Use MegaWave packaging for all self-generated assets.
- Update dashboards with CoBloat metrics.
- Enforce dual-validator (AI + Human) merges.

## Safety Rails
- Hard limits on autonomy during early stages.
- Require provenance tagging.
