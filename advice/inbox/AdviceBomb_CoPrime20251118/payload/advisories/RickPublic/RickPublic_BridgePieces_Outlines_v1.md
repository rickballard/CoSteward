# 1. The Moment Software Learned to Think  
## How Founders Should Navigate the Collapse of Old Institutions

### Section 1  -  The Quiet Threshold
- Not AGI; AI is now “thinking enough” to reshape workflows, tempo, and decision quality.  
- Invisible threshold: capability + availability + human overreliance.

### Section 2  -  Why Institutions Break
- Tempo mismatch: decisions too slow.
- Incentive locking: incumbents resist change.
- Process ossification: workflows fossilized around pre-AI assumptions.
- Regulatory drag.

### Section 3  -  Forced Pivot Checklist
- Which assumptions did AI just break?  
- Which workflows collapse first?  
- Which customer segments move fastest?  
- What competencies become liabilities?

### Section 4  -  Hybrid Decision Systems
- Human + AI co-governance.  
- AI-powered foresight loops.  
- Continuous auditability.

### Section 5  -  Legacy Tech Institution Signals
- Latency: decisions slower than environment.  
- Opacity: no audit trail.  
- Bottlenecks: manual gates multiply.  
- Escalation overload.

### Section 6  -  Post-AI Institutions
- Edge-owned.  
- Evolvable.  
- Transparent.  
- Rapid iteration governance.
