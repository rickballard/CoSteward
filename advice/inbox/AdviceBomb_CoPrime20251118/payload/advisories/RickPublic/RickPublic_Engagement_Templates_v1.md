# RickPublic Engagement Templates v1 (Expanded)

## Purpose
A complete, ready-to-use set of templates for comments, Notes, restacks, and outreach to accelerate Substack discovery and network engagement.

## 1. Comment Templates
### Forced Pivot Lens
“Your analysis is strong. From the forced-pivot perspective, founders face the exact tension you describe: legacy incentives vs. AI-shaped reality. Do you find the harder part is seeing the pivot coming, or executing it?”

### Institution Tempo Mismatch
“This highlights a key issue: institutions can't operate at AI tempo. Without redesigning decision loops, they degrade quietly and fail suddenly. Curious how you'd see boards adapting.”

### Founder Assumption Break
“This aligns with what I’m seeing when AI invalidates a founder’s assumptions. The part on [X] is the kind of pivot-trigger most leaders ignore until too late.”

### Governance as UX
“Refreshing to see governance approached as a design problem. I frame it as building a civic OS that can evolve once systems self-adapt.”

### Gentle Breadcrumb
“Loved this insight  -  especially [X]. I write about forced pivots and institutional futures at RickPublic; this sparked new angles. Thanks.”

## 2. Notes / Restack Snippets
### AI + Founders
“Founders treating AI as a ‘tool upgrade’ instead of a pivot trigger risk getting blindsided. This post reminds why.”

### Institutional Tempo
“If institutions can’t match AI-scale cycles, their failure modes become gradual → sudden. Strong articulation here.”

### WIP Inquiry
“Drafting a piece on the moment leaders realize: ‘our institution is now legacy tech.’ If you’ve lived this, tell me what it felt like.”

## 3. Outreach Templates
### Mid-Tier Outreach
“Hi  -  I write RickPublic (AI, pivots, institutions). Your recent post on [topic] overlaps with a piece I’m publishing. If it resonates, open to a small mutual recommendation? I can highlight a specific post of yours.”

### Reciprocity Follow-Up
“Shared your post with commentary on why it matters for founders. If any of my pieces align with your readers, feel free to share  -  appreciated but not expected.”

## 4. Integration Guidance
Co1 may incorporate these into automated suggestion engines or internal checklists.
