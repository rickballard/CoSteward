# CoGo
## Universal Human→AI Turn-Taking Signal

### Definition
CoGo communicates:
- completion  
- alignment  
- authorization  
- and handoff  

It is the universal signal for AI continuation across CoSuite workflows.

### Use Cases
- Voice mode  
- Multi-session orchestration  
- PS7 workflows  
- CLI interactions  
- CoAgent channel management  

### Voice Mode Discipline
- AI stays silent until CoGo is spoken.  
- A gentle fallback timer prevents “AI-is-dead” scenarios.  
- Only one session may hold the voice channel.  
- CoAgent arbitrates channel access.  

### Rules
1. Silence ≠ CoGo.  
2. CoGo logs are mandatory.  
3. Multi-session conflicts resolved via CoPrime.
