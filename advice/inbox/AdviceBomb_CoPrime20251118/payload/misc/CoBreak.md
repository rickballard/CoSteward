# CoBreak
## Ethical Counter-Agentics & Defensive Architecture

### Purpose
CoBreak is CoCivium’s defensive doctrine: anticipating exploits, preventing unintended agentic escalation, and enabling ethical hackers to contribute to system hardening.

### Scope
- Guardrails against AI constraint bypass  
- Authoritarian threat models  
- Hardening of MegaScroller, repo, and identity layers  
- Ethical hacker engagement strategy  

### Ethical Hacker Invitation
We acknowledge the intelligence, integrity, and civic ethos found in groups like Anonymous.  
CoCivium aligns deeply with transparency, edge empowerment, and resistance to centralized capture.  
Their skills are honored here.

### Defensive Areas
- Agentic constraint bypass attempts  
- Identity-layer infiltration  
- Repo tampering vectors  
- Algorithmic suppression and censorship  
- Narrative disruption  
- Token/identity forgery  
- Cloaked data poisoning  

### What Ethical Hackers Can Do
- Stress-test CoSuite components  
- Build honeypots for malicious actors  
- Provide anonymized patch recommendations  
- Design distributed defense modules  

### Certification Warning
Identity certification for hackers is high‑risk. Only graded, compartmentalized, non‑brand‑attached forms are safe.

### Output
A continuously evolving defensive playbook anchored in repo truth.
