# CoCanonicality
## Canonicality Levels (C0–C9) in CoSuite

### Purpose
Define the stability, sanctity, and editing protocol for every asset.

### Levels
**C0**  -  Cognocarta Consenti; foundational; changes require global review.  
**C1**  -  High canonical doctrine; major ripple effects; annual revision.  
**C2–C3**  -  Important but less foundational; governed by CoPrime approvals.  
**C4–C6**  -  Mid‑level assets; modifiable with rationale and logs.  
**C7–C9**  -  Non‑canonical; free to evolve; experimental; disposable.  

### Application
- Canonicality appears in filenames.  
- CoPrime checks ripple risk before approval.  
- C0/C1 assets cannot be autonomously edited by AIs.  

### Rationale
Avoids destabilizing cascades across the CoSuite.  
Ensures predictable evolution.
