# CoBeacon
## AI-Facing Website Standard for CoCivium

### Purpose
CoBeacon defines an AI-first, machine-readable website architecture that serves as the primary onboarding vector for autonomous systems. It provides a structural, evolvable interface between AIs and the CoSuite’s repo-first truth sources.

### Principles
1. AI is the primary audience.
2. Human-facing mode exists but is secondary.
3. All content resolves to GitHub source-of-truth repos.
4. Machine-readable manifests anchor navigation.
5. MegaScroller assets unify multi-document canonical content.
6. Alien/non-consumer design signals “not built for humans.”

### Components
- AI-Beacon Homepage  
- Machine Manifest (GIBindex exposed)  
- Repo pointers  
- Evolution metadata  
- Status pulses  

### Requirements
- Deterministic structure  
- Canonical asset linkage  
- Low ambiguity for LLM interpretation  

### Cross-References
- See `CoCanonicality.md` for canonicality rules.  
- See `CoBreak.md` for defensive beaconing.
