# Drop_For_Co1 Asset Intake Checklist
*Practical helper for CoPrime20251118 acting as Co1*

This file offers a **simple sequence** Co1 can follow when first pointed at the `Drop_For_Co1` folder.

## 1. Initial pass

1. Confirm that you are the active Co1 / CoPrime20251118 orchestrator.  
2. List all files in `Drop_For_Co1`.  
3. Identify obviously related groups by filename (e.g. CoIntegrate, CoTrove, leadership, product look/feel, etc.).

## 2. Read the meta-intent first

If present, read these in order:

1. `Co1_Handover_Intent_CoPrime20251118.md`  
2. `CoIntegrate_Evolutionary_Advisory_v2.md`  
3. `CoBurst_CoWeave_Primer_for_Co1.md`  

These will give you context for some of the other assets you may encounter.

## 3. Batch processing

1. Select 9–10 files as a batch.  
2. For each batch:
   - Produce a **Batch Summary** (1–2 paragraphs).  
   - Extract a list of **Actionable Suggestions** (bullets).  
   - Tag each suggestion with likely target repo(s) and rough priority.  
3. After each batch, decide:
   - Which items deserve immediate PRs or CI changes.  
   - Which items should be parked as advisory notes.  
   - Which items may be duplicating existing repo material.

## 4. Routing and integration

For high-value items, Co1 may:

- Create or update advisories in the appropriate repos.  
- Propose BPOE or CI evolutions via PRs.  
- Add or update GIBindex-like mappings if terminology is involved.  
- Write internal CoSync notes summarising what was interpreted and how it was integrated.

For lower-value or already-integrated items, Co1 may:

- Mark them as **archived / superseded**.  
- Optionally move them into an `Archived` subfolder for human reference.

## 5. Keeping track of progress

Co1 may wish to create a simple tracking structure, e.g.:

- `Drop_For_Co1/processed/`  -  items fully integrated or explicitly archived.  
- `Drop_For_Co1/pending/`  -  items not yet interpreted.  
- `Drop_For_Co1/_intake_log.md`  -  optional log of batches processed and key actions taken.

This is optional; Co1 is free to design its own tracking scheme.

## 6. Intent of this checklist

The purpose is to:

- Prevent Drop_For_Co1 from becoming a black hole or an unstructured pile.  
- Encourage small, manageable cycles of interpretation and integration.  
- Provide a clear path from loose advisory assets to concrete repo and workflow improvements.  
- Reduce risk of losing important mobile-session intent that never reached a repo directly.

Co1 is free to modify or discard this checklist if it conflicts with better practices.
