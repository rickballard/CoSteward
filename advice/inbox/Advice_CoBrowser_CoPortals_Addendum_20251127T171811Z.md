# Addendum – CoBrowser / CoPortals advisory is additive, not canonical

- Session      : Benedict
- Date         : 2025-11-27 (UTC stamp: 20251127T171811Z)
- Linked note  : Advice_CoBrowser_CoPortals_Urgent_20251127T162814Z.md
- Intended for : Co1 / CoAnchor™, CoPortal+Git, CoAgent™ orchestration, GIBindex stewards

This addendum is here to clarify intent around the original urgent advisory
\$primaryAdviceName\:

## 1. Additive, not overriding

- The advisory **must be treated as additive** to existing and in-flight work on:
  - CoPortal, CoBrowser, CoEdgeControl, CoSurfing / CoRegen,
  - CoCivium™.org CoPortal framing,
  - ProtoCoIndex / GIBindex concept definitions already being drafted in other sessions.
- It is **not** claiming canonical status or attempting to overwrite:
  - any GIBindex entries already drafted or agreed elsewhere;
  - any CoPortal / CoBrowser narratives being refined by Co1, CoPortal+Git, or other sessions.

It is a **seed opinion + framing snapshot** from the Benedict / InSeed focus, intended
to enrich the shared design space, not constrict it.

## 2. How to integrate without collisions

Suggested handling for Co1 and other coordinating sessions:

1. **Diff the framing**  
   - Compare the advisory and this addendum against:
     - existing GIBindex drafts for CoPortal, CoBrowser, CoEdgeControl, CoAgent™, etc.
   - Treat differences as candidate refinements, not as conflicts to be “won”.

2. **Blend into ProtoCoIndex**  
   - Pull out phrases / framings that:
     - make CoPortals feel more obviously AI-facing and CoCivium™-aligned,
     - make CoBrowsers feel like edge-controlled action surfaces instead of just “panels”.
   - Weave them into ProtoCoIndex / GIBindex entries where they genuinely help.

3. **Record provenance**  
   - When concepts from this advisory are adopted, tag them in GIBindex with:
     - source session label: Benedict
     - source repo context: InSeed.com / CoSteward™ / CoCivium™ interplay.

4. **Leave space for evolution**  
   - If later sessions want to pivot the CoBrowser / CoPortal language again, treat this as
     one step in an ongoing CoEvo loop, not a fixed doctrinal position.

## 3. InSeed.com as a CoPortal – additive framing

For the InSeed.com CoPortal face specifically:

- It should:
  - **join** the family of CoPortals already being modelled (CoCivium™.org, CoIndex™, etc.),
  - **inherit** any shared CoPortal BPOE patterns decided elsewhere,
  - **contribute back** examples and copy that can refine those shared patterns.

Requested treatment:

- When other sessions define general **CoPortal** behaviour, please:
  - reference InSeed.com as one concrete CoPortal exemplar (steward-services facing),
  - keep InSeed-specific decisions clearly separated from “global CoPortal doctrines”.

This keeps InSeed work from accidentally dictating how other CoPortals must behave.

## 4. Next steps for BPOE and Ops Manual (pointer)

This addendum anticipates:

- a small BPOE note on **using GIBindex terms in day-to-day workflows**, and
- an **Ops Manual excerpt** showing a GIBindex-linked conversation about auto-evolution
  guardrails between a CoCivite and an AI CoBrowser / CoAgent™.

Those are being dropped as separate draft docs so that Co1 can either:
- fold them into existing manuals, or
- keep them as examples / patterns for future sessions.
