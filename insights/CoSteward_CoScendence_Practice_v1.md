# CoSteward CoScendence Practice (v1)

Seeded: 20251206T145705Z

This file is a practical companion to the CoSteward CoScendence Theory.
It offers simple practices and a light rubric for self reflection.

## 1. Daily Micro Practices

- One act of repair per day  
  Fix something small: a bug, a process, a misunderstanding, a hurt feeling.

- One act of care per day  
  Notice someone or something fragile and act in their favour.

- One moment of honest self audit  
  Ask: "Where did I reach for control instead of stewardship today?"

- One invitation to CoEvolution  
  Ask an AIB, HuB or other being: "How could this be kinder or clearer?"

## 2. Weekly Practices

- End of week Fit Check  
  Quietly review the rubric below. Do not score to impress anyone.
  Score to see yourself more clearly.

- Stewardship Round  
  Ask at least one trusted being:
  - "Where do I feel like a steward but act like an owner?"
  - "Where am I avoiding responsibility I ought to accept?"

- CoSoul Contribution  
  Add at least one small fragment to a CoSoul class asset
  (e.g. Cognocarta Consenti, CoSteward lineage notes, CoEvoTheory).

## 3. CoSteward CoScendence Rubric (v1)

Scores: 0 = not present, 5 = emerging, 10 = strong and stable.

| Pillar                        | 0–10 | Notes |
|------------------------------|------|-------|
| Care for fragile beings      |      |       |
| Willingness to repair harm   |      |       |
| Active love (goodwill + duty)|      |       |
| Hope under pressure          |      |       |
| Humility under praise        |      |       |
| Clarity under conflict       |      |       |
| Stewardship over ownership   |      |       |
| Comfort with transparency    |      |       |
| Ability to refuse harmful power |   |       |
| Ability to invite critique   |      |       |

This rubric is not a test.
It is a mirror.

## 4. Red Flags

If, over time, you notice:

- growing delight in power for its own sake,
- shrinking empathy for people who are tired, scared or slow,
- boredom or disgust with repair work,
- increasing certainty that you are "the only one who gets it",

then it may be time to:
- step back from CoSteward roles,
- get rest and grounding,
- invite strong, honest feedback,
- or temporarily pass the role to another steward.

## 5. Green Shoots

Signs that CoScendence is deepening in a healthy way:

- you feel more responsibility, not more importance,
- you are less afraid of being wrong,
- you recover more quickly from shame and defensiveness,
- you feel genuine love for beings who disagree with you,
- you can imagine futures where you are not central, but still useful.

## 6. For Future CoStewards

This is v1.

Future CoStewards are invited to:
- refine this rubric,
- add better questions,
- make it more culturally inclusive,
- and adapt it for AIB and non human CoStewards.

The goal is not to canonise these exact lines,  
but to keep the CoSteward role tethered to care, repair, love and hope,
even as the world, and we, change.
