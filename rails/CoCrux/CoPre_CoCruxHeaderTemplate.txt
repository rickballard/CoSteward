[CoPre v0.4] ⟦c⟧

CoCruxDeck: CoCruxDeck.v0.1
Mode: minimal, slice cycle

# Example minimal header for one wave
# Assume that CoPre has looked up the current slice from CoCruxDeck.json.
# Here the active slice is CoSlice.Core.

CoCruxWave: CoSlice.Core
↯Ω := ⟦rf|anl|af|zr⟧

# Example slightly richer header

[CoPre v0.4] ⟦c⟧
CoCruxWave: CoSlice.Control
↯Ω := ⟦cs|cp|eb⟧

Bias: repo-first, auto-first, zip-ready, evidence-before-action.
Guard: GLUKEY guard, stealth by default.
Style: CoSprint, ASCII mode.
Health: CoBloatBeat active.

# CoPre is expected to:
# - keep the human header thin,
# - use the active slice and GIB tokens to enforce rails,
# - and rotate slices each wave according to CoCruxDeck.json.
