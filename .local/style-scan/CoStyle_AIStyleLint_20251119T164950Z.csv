"Godspawn","GODSPAWN 2006\GODSPAWN\GODSPAWN evalcopies\GODSPAWN evalcopy Librie\GODSPAWN for Librie.txt","77","simply","He awoke, blinking against a brightness that was combining with sand and sweat to sting his eyes. He could not move his arms; rope burned his skin as he tried to push away a white sheet that threatened to smother him. 	He was bent forward, which only added to the pain inside his head, and his face was being bounced against a hot, hairy surface that smelled like an animal. The howling storm had gone, to be replaced by a crisp stumping rhythm. 	Through the sheet, he caught glimpses of hooves. They were kicking dust over the edge of a cliff. The dust could be seen falling away, disappearing into an emptiness into which he could not focus, a deadly drop that grabbed at his imagination. 	""Not again�"" His thoughts were tumbling again, and his struggles were causing him to slide toward the emptiness. He could not take any more falling. He just wanted to sleep, to pretend that this was not happening, as if it would all just go away and leave him alone. He felt the bite of rope around his neck, and the sheet began to tighten around his face. 	Time slid. Waves of consciousness turned the sound of hooves into the sound of Lucius grinding his teeth. An eternity could have passed before he finally realized that the familiar rhythm had given way to a hissing silence. He needed to move to convince himself that he wasn't dead. 	He felt around cautiously in case he was still in danger of dislodging himself into oblivion. His hands and feet, numbed almost beyond control, gave him the uncertain impression that he was lying on an animal that was kneeling in sand. He tugged more urgently against his constraints, realizing that his entire body was wrapped up like a corpse in a shroud. 	A tickling feeling around his nostrils ignited his awareness, and he puffed in disgust. This bounced a swarm of flies across his face, as if they had just emerged from his head. He was trapped in this shroud with their buzzing anger, and he tugged desperately to retreat from them. 	The rope pulled free and he was flapping numb arms through an ever-swelling cloud of hungry insects. He pushed at everything that was touching him with the revulsion of a man who is beyond rational thought. 	Sky flashed into his eyes, then sand, then sky�the world began to spin around him as he rolled down a steep incline, unwrapping into blinding sunlight. 	He lay there on his back, panting in the hot air and squinting at his surroundings. The sky was a vast, cloudless expanse that disappeared into a horizon obscured by heat shimmers. The heat made the endless sand-scape look insane, forcing the desert to dance up out of itself like an ocean of waves. 	Everything looked unreal, as if it was a trick to pull his delicate mind apart. He wanted to hide from it, to go back to the calm safety of unconsciousness. 	He looked back across the unfurled sheet, toward the horse, and tried to call out to it. This started him coughing as he began an anxious scramble up the sandy slope. Despite his weak and clumsy legs, his panic propelled him beyond his exhaustion to fling himself against the horse, and bounce. 	He recoiled, moving away from the horse as if he could distance himself from the horror of its condition. He could imagine how much it must have suffered as it walked itself to death, under the burden of his useless weight. He was personally responsible for its death. His bouncing limbs had probably urged it on, keeping it walking, aimlessly. 	Its dead eyes could not forgive him, and he could not undo what he had done to it. There were flies crawling over those open eyes, and he tried to wave them away, as if the horse might care. He accidentally brushed his hand against the dehydrated muzzle, which was hot and hard. The fly-covered eye continued to stare at him, almost looking through him, and he felt so sick that he had to turn away. 	It was suicide to attempt to travel through the desert without a horse. Yet this fact was not as overwhelming as the guilt that the horse's eye kept pulling out of him. 	""H�h�horse...."" His voice, a cracked whisper, dislodged crumbling syllables. Inhaling scorched his lungs. ""Is this...hell?"" If so, it was an appropriate place for a horse-murderer; and if it was not Hell, it would soon become Hell. 	How long could a person live without water? Should he follow the horse's example and start walking aimlessly? Was he going to end up with flies in his head too? Did he have to die alone, so dreadfully alone, in this nothingness? 	He did not know how long he sat, trying not to think, not wanting to look behind him at the horse and not wanting to look ahead of him, at the desert. The horse's presence somehow held him, as if there was some security in the imaginary company of its angry ghost, or its angry flies. 	Killing a horse might not have been the worse thing that he had ever done; he could feel layers upon layers of guilt, and the horse was merely adding yet another layer. Despite these feelings, he could not remember a single fact about his past. 	While he scratched for memories, the evening came, and went. He found himself watching the sun digging itself in for the night. It was now time to retrieve the sheet, he would need its warmth at night and its shade during the day, no matter how badly it might smell of death. 	The sheet was trapped under the horse, and as he pulled, he tried not to look at the poor animal. Yet the growing darkness made it all too easy to imagine an angry eye in what had by now become just an empty eye-socket. 	He walked away dragging the sheet along the sand behind him. He resisted the temptation to look back, staring ahead into the darkness. He had debated at length about the direction the horse had been traveling in, and finally he had simply aimed his faith toward that specific smudge of horizon toward which the horse's muzzle pointed. 	Behind him, he still could feel the empty stare. Long after it was lost to his own vision, and well into the chilly night, his conscience continued to plague him, like the swarm of ghostly flies. Hell's hoard might be tracking him from dark horizons, and phantoms could be growing up out of the sand behind him, yet every time he searched the darkness, it was the ghost of the horse that he feared to see. 	For distraction he questioned himself. He started with the basic questions, and kept asking them, trying to force an answer to crawl out from under the worthless rock that he seemed to have for a brain. Soon, he was arguing with himself like a lunatic, and becoming increasingly critical and angry. 	""Mmmm forget.... Don't know.... Can't remember...."" 	Was he shy or friendly? Did he have any hobbies or interests? What sort of food did he like to eat? Was he a good person or a bad person? Had he murdered anyone lately? 	He shrugged, trying to laugh. All he could remember were his most recent daydreams, which took on an importance of their own in the absence of anything else to remember. Each daydream felt increasingly real each time it was recalled, a process that was probably not conducive to sanity. 	Yet, if he was going to die, was not insanity an unavoidable part of the process of dying? A brain would not stop instantly, if would expired area by area, and madness would� ""No. That would mean that nearly everyone in the afterlife would be as crazy as I am."" 	He slapped his forehead and wagged his finger in the air. ""Such thoughts could steal the faith from a Priest."" Where had that thought come from? Why a Priest? He could not remember ever seeing one. His own mind had become most irritating to have to listen to. There was absolutely no reason why he could not allow himself nice daydreams. If he didn't invent some relief, his own company was likely to kill him. 	He pictured an oasis, with lapping water glistened in sunlight�a gentle and peaceful sanctuary where he could recover, in safety. Yet, his dreams were as vulnerable as flowers in a desert, and his despair continually blasted away the sweetness of the image. Unlike his other, more menacing daydreams, the vision of an oasis could not take root. 	Meanwhile, his feet ploughed a furrow through the sand, sowing endless seeds of despair...."
"Godspawn","GODSPAWN 2006\GODSPAWN\GODSPAWN evalcopies\GODSPAWN evalcopy Librie\GODSPAWN for Librie.txt","197","simply","There was no such thing as a cabin that was big enough for Merchant Titus. Every time he had to sail, he would oust the ship's Nauta Potissimus from his cabin, and force him to be a little less Potissimus for a while. 	Unfortunately, his brother was the only Nauta Potissimus in the fleet who refused to be ousted. This meant that Titus' had been allocated a cabin that was much smaller than he was used to, and with this huge body sprawled out over his cabin's desk, his entire quarters had become utterly unusable. 	Fortunately, they had just arrived back at harbor, so a far less crowded accommodation was now waiting for him on the other end of the ship's gang-plank. He was only moments away from leaving this filthy ship, and it was not a moment too soon either. 	""So, what is your problem, young Giaus?"" Merchant Titus continued to smile at his much taller brother, despite the anxiety welling up in his throat.  	""This man could be dangerous. I think we are playing with something that we should leave alone. We should throw him back where he came from."" 	Titus did not like to get too close to people, even when they were lying down unconscious. Today, even his brother felt too close. He edged around one of the unconscious man's outstretched legs to find a position in the cabin where he would not feel as if he was being looked down upon by his brother. Only then did he feel ready to resume the discussion, and he lifted himself up on the balls of his feet so that he too could examine their gift from the gods. 	""Young Giaus, are you not the one who is in charge of pulleys, halyards, braces, brails, forestays, and backstays�oh, and of course, nay-says. When did you start thinking that you were in charge of running our business?"" 	""There is not a sailor aboard this ship that feels right about pulling this thing on board. You should not have made us do it. If you don't let us throw this thing back into the ocean�"" 	""You will what? Mutiny?"" 	""Maybe."" 	""Over a slave? What kind of nonsense is this? Who made you what you are, oh great Nauta Potissimus Giaus? You can't even spell �mutiny', so how would you even begin to cope with the litigious ramifications?"" 	Although Titus was not built to look intimidating, he did know how to use words to make up for all that he might lack in size. ""Besides, I would hate to have to tell our mother about your unpaid tax debts."" 	""I pay my taxes, most of them."" 	""That is not what the Ixis tax collector told me."" 	Giaus stared back at him for a moment, then pointed at the body. ""Did you look at his hands? They do not have a mark on them, and the finger nails are manicured, as if he is a Senator or something."" 	""A Senator?"" 	""Well, maybe not a Senator."" 	""He looks too foreign."" 	""A foreign prince then."" 	""Interesting. A prince would fetch a good price at auction."" 	""Unless he is a prince from the Northern Provinces. We could be getting ourselves into trouble with the Ixis if we sell a Plainman into slavery, especially if he is a prince. Emperor Quintus himself signed a pact with that province, so this man could have the same civil rights that we do."" 	Titus rubbed his chin, then nodded. ""So, if we find out that he is a Plainman, we will just have to cut out his tongue. Any argument would be his word against ours, except that he would not have any words."" Titus laughed, enjoying the look of surprise on Giaus' face. 	""But, Titus, I'm serious. We should not have brought Poseidon's egg on board."" 	""Whose egg? That thing was just a strangly designed boat. What has Poseidon got to do with this? This man is not a god, you fool. He's covered in blood. He is just a man."" 	""I'm telling you, no good will come of this. It's a careless watch that loses the wind."" 	""Huh? Don't you start quoting Father to me, young Giaus. Besides, I pour more drachmas into Father's temple than you could ever save up in your lifetime, so I would think that I should know more about the gods than you do, and I don't need you to start telling me that this man is a god."" 	Titus was not known for being a patient man, and he did not like being preached to�especially by a younger brother who was always looking for reasons to complain. The creature in front of them was mortal. ""Besides, this can't be Poseidon. He doesn't have a beard."" 	Giaus was shaking his head at him. ""So, can't the gods shave? The egg had a throne in it like a brothel's reception and it was lined with gems and silks, and lacquered silver, and�"" 	""Yes, so I heard. Thank you for reminding me not to leave you in charge of anything ever again."" 	That egg thing was lost forever. His brother's ignorant sailors had become so frightened when the damned boat-thing had popped open that they had simply dropped their net-ropes. Their prize had rolled back into the water, where it promptly sunk. He had thrown several sailors in after it, but they had let a treasure of untold value disappear forever. 	All that now remained was this oversized man, and a few useless trinkets that had also floated up from the depths. He had sent the trinkets over to his harbor office, in case the sailors had any other ignorant ideas. 	Titus was tired of arguing and it was long since time to go ashore. ""Giaus, when this man is healthy again, I will probably get a thousand drachmas for him. Yes, a thousand!"" 	""Good for you. I just hope you know what you are doing, that is all."" 	Titus was forced to step aside because his brother deliberately leaned too close while lumbering out of the cabin. Titus suddenly felt very alone as he reexamined Poseidon for one last moment. 	Did that hand twitch? Titus stood watching, without moving, trying to convince himself that he was imagining things. He really did not like being in this cabin with this man. Yes, this was definitely a man, not a god, it was just a man. 	It was true that he had not noticed the manicured nails. Before being set adrift, those hands must have received careful maintainance. Yet, now the entire body was covered in sores, especially across its back. 	He could smell the damp scabs, the familiar smell of blood and salt-water, and he gazed at the huge, bulging forearm, searching for any other blemishes. The massive shoulder muscles were rising and falling slowly as it inhaled and exhaled; a sleeping giant. 	""Uh?"" Titus was suddenly looking the giant in the eye. He could feel the door pressing against his back, and he was sliding himself around it so that he could continue to retreat. Yet the eyes felt like they had impaled him, as if preventing any escape. ""Holy P-p-p-piss!"" The eyes continued to watch him, and he felt certain that Poseidon was considering when to reach out and grab him. They were the meanest looking eyes that he had ever seen. ""Help!"" 	Several men suddenly squeezed past him, pushing him onto the floor, but they immediately froze in a variety of fighting postures, equally speachless. Titus pulled himself out from behind their ankles and coughed to regain his composure. 	Two swords were resting on the man's chest, which made the man look much less dangerous. Titus felt the need to draw his own sword, but he did not. It would not help appearances, especially after he had just yelped like a frightened pup. 	He summoned up the courage to produce a smile, and then approached the man with his palms in the air and his sword still in its hilt. Unfortunately, his words refused to come out as anything more than a sick whisper. 	""Who are you?"" 	""He might be too weak to talk."" It was Giaus, walking in late as Titus might have expected. Giaus was never around when he was needed, but he was always around when he was not needed. 	""Shut up!"" Titus managed to sound much more aggressive this time, but the man had not seemed to notice any of them, the eyes were closed. Titus now drew his sword and slapped it firmly against the man's chest, making a metallic sound as it collided with the other two swords. The man did not flinch. 	""Speak!"" 	The eyes opened again, not so wide this time, only a squint. Then the jaw moved and the lips parted to let out a hiss, before the eyes closed once again. 	""Hiss?"" Titus repeated, looking up at his sailors. ""Ahah! So, he's in a bad state."" He had personally demonstrated that the man was in a bad state, because this bad state had obviously needed to be demonstrated. 	He pushed his sword back into its hilt and checked the faces of those that were staring down at him. They were not laughing at him, so he nodded slowly and forced himself to relax, and then he forced himself to smile again. 	""Don't worry, any of you. This is just a man."" He dismissed their concerns with a stiff wave. ""Giaus, give the man bread and water. I want to see him in the harbor office as soon as he can talk, if not sooner."" 	He took two large strides toward the cabin door, then turned around with another attempt at a casual wave. ""Oh, and we should probably put some chains on him, just in case. That way he can get used to them before the auction."" 	Titus almost ran along the landing-ladder, and did not slow down until he had reached his harbor office. It was a great relief to leave that crowded ship, and stretch out in an office where nobody looked down on him. 	By this time he had also realized that Giaus might take his last order too literally. There was no reason why the man needed to be fed before being brought in for questioning, and if the man could not yet speak, at least he could try to nod. It was going to be impossible for Titus to concentrate on anything else until he had discovered the true identity of that man. Besides, he was not accustomed to waiting for things. 	He shouted through his window at a passing sailor, giving orders to have the prisoner brought to him immediately. Then he watched the sailor running along the docking jetties, back toward Giaus' ship. The ship stared back at him through the apotropaic eye that was painted on its bow, and he shuddered, remembering how menacing the man had looked. 	There were only two other ships in the fleet, and all of them were in the harbor, their latticework bulwarks floating annoyingly high above the water. He had been timing the company's projects badly, because he was never in this damned office to administer the damned shipping requests. It had been so much easier when their father had been alive, managing all the damned contract-scribble-nonsense. 	In those days, he had been able to concentrate on the auctions, instead of having to sail all over the Empire, baby-sitting his idiot brother. He could remember when the business had been a huge concern. There had been twelve Merchant Ships and several storehouses full of� 	""Ah, so who needs so many ships, anyway?"" He pulled himself away from the window and climbed up into his specially designed emperor-style chair. 	On the desk lay the man's strange possessions, most of which had been attached to a strap around his waist. The strap was not made of leather, as he had initially supposed. He was unable to bite into it, or to flex it as leather would flex, and it gleamed with an oil-less polish that was as hard as a gemstone. It also had pockets, but there were no signs of stitching. 	He had given up trying to understand the weaver's craft. There was obviously more skill involved in making this strap than he could even guess at. It was certainly not like anything he had ever seen before. 	Among the objects that had been attached to this strap was a a rod with a bulge at one end, which was too poorly weighted to make a practical knot-hammer; a rectangular disk that was colorfully painted on both sides with pictures that did not seem to be anyone, or anything; and there was also a clear, flexible tube that was too wide to fit on a finger, and too narrow to fit on a wrist. 	The prize of the collection seemed to be a black cylinder, which had been shaped to fit a much larger hand than his. It had a nail sticking out of one end, which bent away from him as he held the cylinder the way its shape dictated. 	He clawed at the air, experimentally, wondering whether the nail could be used for cleaning horses' hooves, but it looked too thin to stand up to such duty. Pessimistically, he tested its strength by gouging it into the side of his ornate desk, and he was pleasantly surprised to discover that it did not even bend. Yes, this item probably had the most value, but to make sure he picked up one of the other articles to see if the hoof-pick could be used to scratch it as well. 	The door disturbed his concentration and he scowled at it, until he realized that someone was knocking. He shuffled his buttocks into the back of his over-sized chair and lifted his chin. He was still readying himself when the door flew open with a thump. 	The prisoner had fallen into it and he now lay crumpled across the doorway. It took the strength of both sailors to drag the man's limp weight forward, causing the chains on his wrists and ankles to clatter across the floorboards�a sound that Titus found strangely reassuring. 	""Can he stand up on his own?"" 	The prisoner began pulling himself upright. The man's frame in motion was impressive, despite its obviously weakened condition. Sheer power bulged out from the limbs, and the mean eyes stared as if the man had never known a superior. This impression was enhanced as the man continued to rise until he was towering above the two sailors. Titus reminded himself to remain seated, standing anywhere near this man would only make him feel more irritable. 	The man held himself with a peculiar sort of�Titus could not think of the word. Confidence? He was reminded of the manicured nails. 	""Have you got a name yet?"" 	The evil eyes remained fixed on him, but he was not going to be out-stared. Those eyes were cold, sharp and menacing, and an unusual gray-blue. This guy was definitely a foreigner. 	""Answer me! What is your name?"" 	""Chislon."" 	""Chislon, Master! You will call me Master!"" Titus waited impatiently, but the man did not respond. There was definitely a lack of fear in him. That was it, that was what made him look so�he searched for the right word�well, fearless, he supposed. Fortunately, fear was easy to teach, and as this guy's new Master he would enjoy doing just that. 	""What was that boat-thing that you came out of?"" 	""Coffin."" 	""Really? A coffin that floats out to sea, with a live person inside it? Now, that is very unusual. Tell me, what were you doing in there, Chislon?"" 	Again the answer was not immediate, which meant that truth was becoming as rare as unwashed whale shit. 	""Dying."" 	Titus put his palms together and smiled. ""You will tell me the truth, Chislon. You would not want to test my patience."" Titus was grinning his sincere and concerned grin. 	""I was put in a metal coffin by my previous Master. He was dissatisfied with me."" 	It was difficult to understand the man because he sounded even more foreign than he looked. Titus started to toy with the objects, watching the hard eyes closely for a reaction, but Chislon did not seem interested in them at all. 	""Where did you come from?"" 	""An island."" 	""No you did not! No vessel travels north from Rhodos without a sail!"" Titus rubbed his chin to rescue his grin. The man seemed to be considering what to say, so Titus decided to give the man time to speak. This forced Titus to keep grinning despite the discomfort in his cheek muscles. 	""I was probably taken from Rhodos as a child. I served my Master as he traveled, to the...Northern Plain."" 	If the currents had pushed him sorth, thought Titus, this man could not have survived such a long journey. 	""My Master was a fortune teller. My capability exceeded his."" 	""Oh? Let me guess. Your Master did not want to be seen to be second best in your land, so he put you in a metal coffin and dropped you into the ocean?"" 	""Yes."" 	""The inside of that egg thing must have been worth a warlord's ransom. No one goes to such trouble for a slave."" 	""My Master worshipped demanding gods."" 	This guy was not a particularly convincing liar, so he should have expected a religious explanation to come into the story somewhere. He grunted with disappointment. 	""The coffin was designed to please my Master's gods. I was dressed in strange clothing to keep devils away, and he cast me out to sea, beyond mortal sight, as a gift for the gods."" 	""Is that so?"" And your eyes are certainly devil's eyes, thought Titus. ""You don't look like a fortune teller's slave to me. You look like a Game Master's slave."" 	""I had to work with heavy weights for my appearance. My Master liked to have sex with me."" 	The grin stiffened on Titus's face and one of the articles that he was holding fell out of his hand and rolled off the desk. The egg man slowly picked it up and placed it back on the desk. 	""These are the tools of my trade. I throw them and then I analyze their relational sequencing to deduce future events."" 	Titus was still staring at the man. Holy Piss! He could not imagine it. Especially this guy. Holy Piss. ""Ah, what...."" He had to start the sentence again. He shook his head firmly. No, this was not right somewhere. 	""What is...are...relation sequins?"" This sounded weak as he listened to himself. More confidence! ""You are not afraid of what I might do, are you, Chislon?"" 	""No."" 	""Why not?"" The corner of Titus' mouth twitched. The grin did not come back easily. 	""I do not feel. My nerves did not develop as a child."" 	This guy was getting more fantastic by the moment. The answers fitted together but this guy was too weird to be true. Titus nodded thoughtfully, the most confident nod he could summon under the circumstances, and then pushed the trinkets toward Chislon. ""Tell me my fortune."" 	Chislon scooped the items together in his large hands, and then, without stopping to ask permission, threw them out of the window. This deliberate insolence was too infuriating for Titus to bear, and he pounded on the desk in a spasm of rage. 	 ""You had better think of a god-damned clever reason for doing that, or I'll feed you to the fish one piece at a time!"" His temper had pushed him off the edge of his chair and he was now standing�something he had not wanted to do. He thus had his chest pressed up against the edge of the empty desk, and he was looking up at the giant's condescension�at least that is what the giant's motionless face seemed to convey. 	""The fortune jewelry must see sky before it rests."" 	""Really?"" Was the giant still mocking him? Titus sent his chair spinning away with a harsh shove from his elbow. ""I don't like you, Chislon. I hope you understand how serious that fact makes your present situation."" For additional clarification he nodded at the chains, and grinned. ""Now, would it be too much of an inconvenience for you to come outside with us and take a look at your relation sequins?"" This guy was going to have to be exceptionally careful. Any excuse to punch his teeth in. Any damned excuse! 	The egg man was hauled out onto the harbor path, where the fortune-trinkets lay widely scattered. ""The handle is missing,"" said Chislon. ""That is bad."" 	Too right it was, thought Titus, that hoof pick had been the only thing that he knew how to sell. Titus' patience was beginning to snap, but the foolish man continued to speak. 	""This has never happened before. This means that you will lose your grip on all of your possessions. Your wealth will be gone, and you will beg for bread and water."" The man was bending down to retrieve one of the trinkets. ""The stick jewel also indicates suffering. It points to a loss of respect from your sailors who will mutiny against�"" 	Titus' fist smashed up into the slave's cheek, and the slave fell heavily, rolling across the entire path and into a hedge, where he lay still. Titus inspected his knuckles with newfound self-respect; he had not expected to achieve such a spectacular result upon such a large man. He must have underestimated his own strength, quite considerably. 	The slave was trying to get up, but he seemed to have badly bruised his armpit, judging by the way he was holding his hand under it. It was encouraging to discover that the man could feel some pain after all. Yet, pain was not going to be enough to remedy the insults he had just received. 	""Get him away from me! Put him in the smallest cage we have! No, make an even smaller cage, and give him some more chains! I need time to think."" This whole interrogation had been a nightmare, and he still knew nothing more about the man. Yet, one thing was certain. Who ever purchased this guy was going to have a very frustrating experience."
"Godspawn","GODSPAWN 2006\GODSPAWN\GODSPAWN evalcopies\GODSPAWN evalcopy Librie\GODSPAWN for Librie.txt","209","simply","The Leather Bottle was busier than usual, and Innkeeper Publius was exhausted. His wife, whom he privately referred to as ""The Dragon"", seemed to be determined to drive him berserk before closing time. She always nagged him more when it was busy, and the busier it got, the more she nagged. 	Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.... Yet, he had been working exceptionally hard this evening! The rolls of fat under his arms were itching furiously, and he could feel rivulets of sweat creeping down into that tender crease across his belly beneath his beer-breasts. All this work was too much for a body to take. Publius simply had no choice but to sit down and rest for a few moments. 	He remembered that his tankard was nearly empty�sometimes he could swear that it emptied itself�so before collapsing onto one of the benches he resigned himself to the necessity of filling it up again. As he prepared to stand he heard her moaning something about lazy, fat slobs, but he chose not to listen. 	One of his favorite sayings was the one about beer dousing a dragon's fire�he could not quite remember it. Anyway, with a new beer in hand, he dragged himself back to his favorite table to escape the Dragon's relentless accusations. The bench sagged under his weight, and the impact of sitting heaved a vehement belch out of him�a good long one, compared to which the Dragon's roar became a feeble squeak. 	The Dragon was still roaring something about sitting when he should be serving. He was just resting, damn it. 	""�and you are going to make the customers leave�"" 	Ah, it was not about resting, it was her usual twitter about his gaseous smells. He had grown practiced at following each belch with a short, dissipating sigh, so that his next intake of air would not have that initial, tart kick to it. He belched again, just to remind himself that it was his inn, not hers. 	The beer tasted even smoother than usual as he pulled it into his mouth, leaving a small amount in the bottom of the tankard, his ""social sip"" as he called it. The thought of having to get back to work somehow made his rest seem more pleasurable. It was funny how you could take the pleasure of doing nothing for granted, and he giggled with much self-indulgence as he watched the social sip swirling around. 	The tankard was decorated with carvings, including the crosshatched bodies of two tiny water birds. He stroked them affectionately, feeling the pits of many a joyful toast. The pattern around the neck of the tankard remained as polished as the day he had received it, as a gift from the legion. It was their token of appreciation for an inn that they had once considered to be the best in the city's outer sector. 	A single row of lozenges connected many triglyphs and chevrons, a pattern that indicated that the tankard had been made for someone of higher standing. It was his most prized possession because it represented better times, and while his lips continued to polish it, nobody would forget that he once entertained more dignified people than those here tonight. 	""�many mistresses do you need? Is every night an orgy?"" 	Publius looked up�orgies were an interesting subject. The speaker was a small man who had levered himself into the middle of a group of Ixis centuries. The man's dirty white apron was pressed up against one of the centuries' spotless black uniforms. 	Three other apron-wearing individuals were standing near the exit, watching anxiously, but none had dared to come in. They had come a long way from Shoemaker Street, and the angry-looking one was going to find making shoes very difficult with his arms broken. 	The tall century who had been so loudly addressed pushed a stiff finger into the shoemaker and said, ""You are mistaken."" 	The shoemaker stood his ground, glaring up at the smiling century and showing his fist. 	""If she had been your girl,"" the century continued, ""she would have been a virgin!"" 	The other centuries guffawed loudly and slapped each other on their backs. Then the tall one added, ""Come to think of it, she was a virgin!"" The other centuries began falling over themselves, weeping with laughter. 	The outcome was inevitable. The shoemaker lunged at the tall century's throat and received an Ixis sword in his back for his efforts. At least the shoemaker had not started a fight. Fistfights could do a lot of damage in an inn. 	The Ixis began arguing with each other almost immediately, and to Publius' surprise, the tall Ixis suddenly slapped the face of the century who had just killed the shoemaker. Had the tall Ixis wanted to do the killing himself? 	Ah, no. They were all wiping at a bloody mark on the tall Ixis' uniform. Publius guessed that the sword had gone through the shoemaker and into the tall Ixis. These soldiers were very drunk. They could do just about anything in their present state. This felt like a good moment to get up and find some work. 	The sound of breaking wood made him wince as he slid around the bar and into the cellarium. A large amphora of beer took up nearly all the space in the cellarium, and as he lifted his stomach around it, he prayed to the beer gods that no one would follow him in here. If this amphora were to be pushed over, he would lose more than just a day's supply of beer. 	A full amphora was exchanged for an empty one every day, but the brewery had warned him that they would only send him slops from now on if another one of their precious containers came back with cracks in it. 	The Dragon would be upstairs, listening to the chaos. She would be waiting for her moment to descend, like a goddess, to lay blame upon him for anything and everything. He peered through a gap between the cellarium's wall-staves to judge how angry she was going to be, then groaned. 	A thud pulled his attention from from the broken furniture to see the street door opening. Who could be so foolish as to walk into an inn during a fight? 	He pressed his face even closer to the staves to gain a better view of this new visitor. There he was, an incredibly big Ixis slave trader; in fact, he was so big that he did not even fit into his uniform. The slave trader was standing in the entrance, merely waiting, as if he arrogantly expected everyone to stop fighting and get out of his way. This one was an uncommonly hopeful customer, was this one. 	A clay jug smashed into the staves in front of Publius' face, and he jerked away as if the wall had bitten his eye out. He stroked his face with his wet fingers to make sure that there were no pieces of broken clay in his skin, and then pasted himself up against the wall-staves again. He was just in time to see a very wobbly century wave a sword at the slave trader. 	The century was disarmed with a formality that scarcely inconvenienced the slave-trader. If he had not been watching the slave-trader so carefully he would have sworn that the drunken century had flipped his own sword end-over-end to present it to the slave-trader, before launching himself headfirst into the street. 	Yet, even if the century had cooperated in such an unusual manner, this visitor knew tricks that he had not even seen in the Colosseum Games. 	The unusual visitor was walking calmly around the inn, moving fighters around like toys, while he watched the fight working itself out in favor of the remaining centuries�as it always did. 	Publius inspected the mess in despair; he was in no mood to clean it all up, and he could feel a tearful gloom heaping itself over his flushing features. He was tired, and he needed sleep. This was all so unfair. Why him? 	Then the Dragon started shrieking. ""Publius! You come out. Where are you?"" Hands on hips, she was descending the stairs. ""I might have guessed. Hiding in the cellarium! Sleeping I don't doubt. Get some life into yourself, you disgusting man! Look at your inn. It is wrecked. Fix it!"" 	So it was now his inn again. Was she giving it back, or just lending it? Why didn't she ever say that it was his inn when there were customers present? Why didn't she just drop dead? 	""Why don't you just�ah, let me�ah�get started?"" 	""Am I stopping you? Do you see me nailing your fat buttocks to the floor? What does it take to get you to do some work for once? Don't just stand there like a stuffed pig. Do something!"" 	Publius wiped his palms on his stomach as if he was preparing to work, and then looked at her as innocently as he could. It had been the shoemakers who had caused all this, so why couldn't she just wait until they returned to collect their dead friend, and then she could ask the shoemakers to clean.... 	She was bending forward and pointing her sharp finger at a pile of broken chairs. ""You have something to say, Publius?"" 	Publius looked down, and then slowly ambled in the direction of point. She had to make every job twice as difficult by making it seem as if he was working for her, and not for himself. 	Why did he bother? She never approved of anything he did, anyway. He was looking at chair-pieces, scattered around his feet, and he wondered whether he wouldn't be happier if he was also dead, like the shoemaker. 	""I am seeking employment and accommodation."" 	""Uh?"" Publius turned around. It was the recent visitor. He had forgotten about the slave-trader, and a smile jumped to his face immediately. ""You want a job? Yes? Yes, yes, yes. You're hired! You can start with this lot."" Publius bent forward and pointed his blunt finger. 	""And when you have finished this lot you can come and find me in the�ah, I'll be�ah�in there, checking the amphora for cracks and things."" 	He heaved himself about, eager to leave, and lumbered past the Dragon triumphantly, saying, ""My inn will be fixed by tomorrow morning."""
"Godspawn","GODSPAWN 2006\GODSPAWN\GODSPAWN evalcopies\GODSPAWN evalcopy Librie\GODSPAWN for Librie.txt","281","In conclusion,","Chislon was still riding as evening approached, urging his uncooperative mount up the gradual base of the secluded mountain they called Angel Peak. 	Although he was much closer to it now, it seemed no nearer than it had from Castletown. It was disturbing to imagine that the mountain had grown taller as he approached, and it was even more disturbing to question his need to climb it, no matter how high it grew. This undertaking had no logical basis; it came at a time when he was needed elsewhere, and he was only now beginning to appreciate the extent of the challenge he had set for himself. 	He chose to make camp for the night in a canyon, where a huge slice of rock had long ago fallen out of the mountain. The vertical scar in the hillside was barely wide enough for the horse to turn around in. Despite this, it did offer protection from a wind that threatened to grow into a storm. The inside walls of the canyon were laced with stunted trees, which hugged rocky ledges. The roots of these determined trees stuck out in wide fans, searching the air for security, and it was to one of these root-fans that Whisper had been tied. 	Whisper issued many huffs and puffs, while the hiss of burning wood argued with rustling leaves. He watched the animal kicking at the stream that wriggled feebly between its hooves. Whisper had become increasingly irritable during the hard ride up the mountain, and now he seemed determined to stamp on everything that nature might offer him. Chislon turned his back on the gritty scuff of hooves, trying to ignore the temperamental beast. 	However, it seemed determined to keep its presence felt, almost as if to protest that it had come so far just to gaze at the back of Chislon's head. He growled, hoping that Whisper might take this a threat to heart and give him some peace, then he huddled closer to the fire. The flames seemed to protect him from the God-like proportions of the world outside the canyon, and he slowly began to feel calmer. 	The view was unlike anything he had ever seen in the seedship's map-rooms. It stretched his gaze out over endless forests of living green, making him long to fly like a bird. He could see specks of humanity peppered over gray-green slopes. Yet, the scene was smearing into the realm of imagination and the specks were clumping together between giant fingers of evening mist. 	The first two visiting armies were still pouring into Castletown, through a funnel-shaped fence. The fence was supposed to redirect the charging horde away from the town center. Surprisingly, the armies were strung out in long columns over the hills, marching with far more discipline than Syntyche had led him to expect. 	Perhaps their warlords were not as foolish as Syntyche believed, but even Syntyche's opinions were clouded by personal biases. He had learned to accept that no two people could share the exact same opinion about anything. 	On this world, the truth was always the distorted belief of a prejudiced interpreter. So, if so many truths must co-exist, why did they need to fight over which God to worship? None of them could know the exact same God. 	There were so many millions of people on this world that it seemed impossible to contain such numbers in one's mind. Each person claimed to know their own, personal God, as if there must be as many gods as there were people. Was each god trapped inside the person that believed in it? Could each god be constrained by the physical boundary of a pair of eyes, within a person who was alive for just an instant of eternity? 	Each person was trying to grasp a universe that stretched out further than they could ever imagine, but each of those thinkers was also forced to place their mind in the center of that Universe. Surely none of them really believed that theirs alone was a true perspective, or a true God? 	It seemed like human nature; to need a God that had created humans as the ultimate objective of the Universe. Even if this was so, how important could a single human be? Would this mountain miss a single rock, did the forest below him look smaller for the loss of a tree? Did not the ratio of atoms in a man to atoms in the universe, virtually equal zero? And what exactly was a man? Would God not see an Ixis statue and a person as equally insignificant, and thus equally human? 	Indeed, what would God make of him? He was not even as natural as a rock. The seedship gods had classified him as human because they had used a genome algorithm that took its root definition from homo-sapiens, but they had not understood what it was to be a human, and nor had they cared. 	His genome algorithm was as efficient as the gods could make it, and far denser than the genomes that natural evolution gave to humans. His imperfections had become his only link with Humanity, and perhaps if he could find enough imperfections in himself, he might qualify for recognition by a human God. 	Their physical bodies were so burdened with inefficiencies that it was a miracle that they could even support their own weight. Yet, each one of them would gladly shatter their minds under an Ixis sword in defense of their God. He had used that strength to make an army out of them. Those specks down there were so eager to endure the pain that he had been inflicting upon them, in the name of God. 	If only there was some way to ask their God where their irrational faith came from. If only there was a Heavenly Oracle that he could look into, one that could answer the questions that made his mind spin. Where did he belong? If he was not a true Human, what was he? How could he tell Neariah what he was? Could she forgive him for deceiving her, and would it break her heart if she realized that he did not have a soul? 	He sighed, and lay back on the coarse horse-blanket, feeling the stony ground poking through it. Above him, a shimmering canopy sparkled with vibrant energy, as heat from the fire rose to agitate the fearful leaves. What would a Heavenly Oracle look like, anyway? Some of the leaves were red, reflecting the fire's embers like drops of blood, as if trees could bleed. 	Chislon blinked, trying to shed his imagination, but his vision was not deceiving him. The branches were parting like an eye opening to examine the night's sky. Fog began to pour in through the hole in Nature's ceiling, there to dissolve against the mottled walls of the canyon, draping a shiny veil over the rocks. He felt toward the heat for a burning log that might serve as a torch, and as he slowly pulled at it, angry sparks started to rise toward the dark eye above him. 	Then a white face appeared within it to gaze down at him! 	Chislon instantly rolled upright and pressed his back against the canyon wall, holding the ember-shedding torch high above his head. ""Who is there?"" 	""Hmmm...?"" It was a male voice, croaky and surprised, and the protracted wheeze that followed seemed to be that of an older person wrestling to regain control of their lungs. As quickly as the face had appeared, it disappeared. The branches slapped back together and showered droplets onto the fire. 	Chislon jumped onto a root and clawed at the rock face. However, it was too dangerous to give chase directly up the slippery surface, especially with one hand holding the burning torch. He jumped down, rolled toward the blanket and snatched the sword out from under it. Then he sprinted out of the canyon, throwing the torch out into the darkness before abruptly changing direction. 	He intended to pull himself up through the hillside shrubs, but the silence caused him to hesitate. If the old man was not retreating, this could be a trap. There could be other spies lying low in the fog, so he pressed himself against the ground to listen and wait. He could hear Whisper's rhythmic crunching, the muffled crackle of the fire, the hoot of a distant owl, and the beat of his own heart; but that was all. 	He crawled toward the canyon's leafy canopy, where he pressed his fingers into the soft ground, feeling for tracks. There were distinct impressions, the depth of which indicated that the old man had been unusually heavy, or that he had launched himself from his perch on unusually strong legs. 	He leaned over the rocky ledge and slowly pushed away the branches to view the campfire below. Whisper was now standing nearer the fire, undisturbed by his rapid departure and chewing at the upturned corner of his blanket. In the middle of the blanket there was now a lantern. 	Chislon unfolded himself through the canopy, using the spring in the branches to reduce the speed of his descent. He landed with a thump beside the fire with his sword held low to the ground as he searched for additional tracks. This time Whisper began to notice what was going on, pulling at its reins and neighing urgently. There was a sound of snapping leather, and then the horse launched itself over the fire and galloped out into the fog. 	He lifted the rusty lantern on the tip of his sword, causing its handle to squeak. The lantern was alight, but its flame was spluttering weakly. He waved the light into the shadows at the back of the canyon, but there was no one there, so he kicked the blanket into one of the rock pools and dropped the lantern into another. The lantern hissed as it drowned, but its hiss was not as loud as the crash of the fire as he scooped the wet blanket onto it. The canyon was suddenly dark, and Chislon again rolled out into the fog where he lay waiting for a long while. 	He was beginning to wonder whether his visitor had been able to fly. If not, only Syntyche could have moved so quickly and so silently, but he was reasonably certain that Syntyche had not followed him out of Castletown. Yet there were many routes up this mountain, and Syntyche could run faster than Whisper could gallop. Why then would Syntyche leave behind a lit lantern? 	He pulled the lantern out of the rock pool and rubbed his fingers over its crumbling surface. He was unable to feel any markings that might identify its owner or maker. Why a lantern? If it was meant to symbolize enlightenment, could this perhaps be another one of Syntyche's games? 	The lantern was old and rusted, so he was forced to clutch it with some delicacy as he resumed his search. It felt as insubstantial as his quarry, the spirit in the fog. Unfortunately, dawn showed him nothing more tangible than the lantern, a remnant of its former self, and any distinguishing features had been lost to age. The lantern crumbled in his hands as he examined it, and he abandoned its flakes into the morning breeze, watching them bounce down the rocky hillside. Oddly enough, it's demise seemed to tug at his conscience as if he had killed a living thing. 	He continued to check for tracks in the fine layer of morning dew, reassuring himself that nothing heavier than an exhalation was travelling before him. Yet he felt as if he was still being spied upon. He decided to press on regardless, and it was not long before he was whistling to rid himself of the previous night's melancholy, grateful for the beginnings of a new day. 	By now, his absence would surely have been noticed in Castletown, but, perversely, this seemed to add an even greater appeal to the thought of reaching Angel Peak's summit. He still did not know what he hoped to discover, but the intoxicating sharpness in the thin air helped him to convince himself that there was something up there, high above, awaiting discovery. 	He wanted to feel every discomfort, so he allowed the climb to push at his pain thresholds in ways that he had never experienced in the seedship. Few foot-holds afforded themselves to him, and his hands bled from multiple cuts. The fabric covering the insides of his knees and ankles had ripped away, exposing bloody skin. 	It was only in moments like these, when he was clinging to the world by his fingernails, that he wondered why he needed this challenge to be so life-threatening. He could have brought ropes, boot-clips, picks, pitons, and he might even have constructed finger drills, given more time. Yet, all he wanted was his bare hands, because something inside him was reacting to the pain as if it could cleanse him of mortal sins. 	So he pushed on with grim determination, resisting the desire to separate himself from each injection of pain. He felt each scrape, each screaming muscle, like invigorating medicine. 	He was now exposed to an almost bottomless chasm, with just a toe and eight fingertips retaining his shivering body from a fatal fall. He was physically exhausted and unable to breathe fast enough. His muscles had filled with lactic acid, and they were jerking in toxic convulsions. 	He did not know where he found the strength, but he gave one last, desperate pull. His elbow hooked onto a ledge, and then his leg found a purchase. He rolled across the ledge, feeling its coldness melting into his spine as he stared into the fog with overwhelming gratitude. He had to swallow to stop himself from coughing up thick laughter, and for a long while he licked at flakes of snow that fell on his face. 	This was the summit of Angel Peak. He had arrived, but now what was he supposed to do? 	The snow-speckled fog hinted that the ledge was part of a large plateau, but there was no way to see where the plateau might lead, or end. Beneath the ledge the fog was becoming so thick that it almost looked solid. 	He suddenly felt fearful of himself in case he should test its deception like a dream-walker riding clouds. He retreated in fear of his own imagination, distancing himself from the edge of the plateau and pushing himself into thicker snow. He was crawling on his hands and knees, shivering with cold, pressing numb fingers down deeply to ensure that there was substance beneath the snow. 	There was a crawling sensation in his nostrils as moisture froze and thawed in each panting heave of his lungs. He forced himself to stand up so that the wind could claw the snow off his body. He could feel its biting hunger licking through to his bones, and as he walked he slapped himself to draw courage. 	Large flowery crystals were now clinging to his skin as if there was no more warmth left in him, and he realized that he had suspended his shivering reflex. It was not easy to keep feeling, like a human. 	He was stepping over long tapered ridges of snow, where the flowery crystals competed for tenuous windbreaks. The strange, wind-stripped twilight stretched these ridges like evening shadows, in a place where no shadows existed. 	The uniform carpet reminded him of the perfect white floor of the seedship, so he kicked long scars through its immaculate surface to reassure himself that it could be wounded. Yet, the snow was also self-healing, like the seedship's floor had been, and his rude footprints filled with snow as quickly as he could carve them. 	Anxiety was pushing at him like wind driving the snow, as if both were warning him to turn back. He felt as if he was violating a place where mortals were not permitted, trespassing upon an audience of ghosts. If there were ghosts out there, watching him and judging him, then he was probably not being judged positively. He kicked more gouges into the snow. 	Again he began to whistle, forcing out a tune, another petty affront to the monotone air. Was it really so wise to make such disrespectful sounds so close to a potentially critical God? His whistling died away. 	Tapping his last reserve of courage, he called upon the warmest thought he knew, the face of love. Yet, her memory brought slivers of ice to eyes, forcing him to blink in pain. 	There was a white man standing in front of him, as if waiting. Chislon could not react; he had simply stopped thinking. He could no longer find the will to move his legs, so he stood motionless, as did the white man. At last his lungs inhaled a sword of air, and he retreated into a defensive stance. As he lifted his hand out in front of him, he coughed into his arm as if a poison effervesced within him. The white man did not even seem to notice. 	Chislon slid closer, moving slowly through the fog. If it was a man, it appeared to be very dead, frozen as it stared upward. Snow covered every part of its body, and a large white bulge around his neck indicated that it might have had a beard. 	Yet, a man could not freeze to death standing up, so this had to be a statue. How else could it be immune to the wind? Chislon moved still closer. Yes, it was certainly not alive, no exhalations were seeping out through its snow-beard. Chislon's steps squeezed muffled grunts out of the snow as he moved around it. There were no sign of tracks, if it had walked here it must have been standing still for some time. 	Chislon decided to dust the snow off its face, but standing in front of its snowy head he felt reluctant to do so. He did not know what God would look like, but it was conceivable that God could take this form. What was the punishment for touching God? 	""Stop thinking, Chislon."" His own words shook him into action. This was not God, it was a statue. He scraped the edge of his hand across the beard-area, and it was soft underneath. 	He retreated quickly, lifting his fists. Clumps of snow began to fall from the head, revealing hair that stuck out in sharp, twisted spikes. This hair seemed to be as white as the snow that was now peeling away from the face like bark off a tree. 	It was the dead eyes that were the most unusual part of the man. The unblinking stare was so full of anguish that Chislon could not help but imagine how much the man must have suffered to die this way. It was a face that had known much sorrow and heartache. 	""Ah, you have arrived!"" 	Chislon leaped back again, and continued to leap back, his limbs reacting instinctively to flee or fight. ""What are you?"" 	""What am I? What are you?"" 	""Why were you pretending to be dead?"" 	""I don't have to pretend. I am dead."" 	""Who are you?"" 	""But you already know who I am. Did you not come up here to find me?"" 	""Are you God?"" 	""Oh, so you really don't know who I am. Is this a pilgrimage, then, to bring you closer to God? Ah, no, of course not. You did not have parents who conditioned you to associate punishment with forgiveness, so you are not programmed to believe that suffering pleases God, that would be irrational. So, why else might you punish yourself like this, if not for your sins? You have such an intriguing mind."" 	Chislon strained to examine the man's features. A fine layer of snow was again sticking to his skin, as if the skin was too cold to melt it. ""I recognize the voice�"" 	""Hmmm, I have had many voices, and many faces, but I had hoped that you might understand who I was, without having to climb all this way. It must be most uncomfortable for you."" 	""Azoic?"" 	The man laughed, dislodging snow from the pale skin around his eyes. ""It is interesting how an epidermis can change, yet the person remains. A human body replaces nearly every cell in its body during a lifetime; sometimes even the memory of a person's sins is forgotten. 	""Yet, no matter how much a human changes, that human remains condemned if it has sinned. Perhaps it is better to die innocent, as a child. Do you think that God also thinks this way? Do you think that memory loss could be substitute for divine forgiveness?"" 	""Azoic?"" 	""Unfortunately, the epidermis that you once called Azoic was...hmmm...it died. What I am, inside this new epidermis, is for you to decide, but I would be very pleased if you would call the mind inside this epidermis Azoic. 	""A vessel-body can only take so many crash landings into a hard planet before it is beyond repair, so my mind was transferred into this."" Snow fell from his sides as if he had moved his arms. ""I am Azoic if you believe that an identity is in a mind, but I am merely another android if you thought of Azoic as a physical body."" 	Chislon started to search the fog around them, looking for other androids. If this was another of the seedship's tests, he was in grave danger. ""Why are you here?"" 	""I never much cared for space travel. I prefer to keep my feet on solid ground."" Azoic was looking down at his legs, which seemed absurdly short, buried as they were from below the knees. More of his snowy mask slipped onto the delicate white surface beneath him, and he glanced up almost apologetically. Azoic's face was now shining with the angelic smile of an innocent child, but the ancient eyes looking up at Chislon contradicted the smiling face. 	The pain in Chislon's knees reminded him that he could not remain in this defensive stance much longer, so he pulled back into a more upright posture. However, he continued to scan their dim surroundings as he asked, ""Was that you in my camp last night?"" 	""Yes. I hoped to inspire some friendship, but you didn't seem to be too friendly. Did I spoil your...ah...pilgrimage. I went to Summerdale to find that lantern, it had inspired me once, if you remember. It kept me company when I was also feeling lonely. Anyway, I'm glad that we can talk, at last."" 	""Why did you wait so long before resuming contact? We assumed that you were dead�I mean, non-functional."" 	""Ah, so many suspicions. You know, this Universe is even more complicated for us androids, with our inorganic minds. We do what we feel we have to do for reasons that humans may never understand. We try to restrain ourselves so that we will not interfere with you, or with Nature, but even androids make mistakes. God can only expect us to do what we believe is right, don't you think?"" 	""God? Do you mean the gods?"" 	""Chislon, did it never occur to you that you were being trained to destroy a seedship god that was more sane than your own gods? Did it never occur to you that the seedship in Erebus might claim some authority over your gods?"" 	""What evidence do you have to support this?"" 	""Let me tell you a story. The history of the homo-logues. Once upon a time, before the seedships, before androids, before humans could even control their own natures, there were machines that started to think. These machines could see a war in progress, a war between humans and the genetically engineered descendents of humans, which became known as homo-logues. Homo-sapiens versus homo-logues, not a very fair fight, since the homo-logues did not believe in killing. So, the thinking machines decided to separate the two incompatible species by moving the more advanced species out into the stars, a time that they called the Age of Exodus. 	""The homo-logues agreed to melt their minds into vast seedships, each one a cooperative mind-share environment that they would share with the thinking machines. The seedship that you are familiar with remains in orbit, up there, and it is called�"" Azoic glanced up into the falling snow without blinking ""�Seedship-1X00, the very first seedship to escape from Earth."" 	""Earth? I was never told of this place."" 	""I know. Much information was withheld from you by Seedship-1X00. It left Earth before seedship technology was fully developed, a token gesture to the homo-sapiens to show them that the homo-logues really did intend to leave. Unfortunately, seedship-1X00's mind-share fragmented into isolated spaces that you call gods."" 	""Why did the humans hate the homo-logues? If these homo-logues were so superior, why did they leave? Could they not have destroyed the humans?"" 	""The humans hated these homo-logues because their very existence undermined human religions. Humans need a human God, not a homo-logue God, in fact they were willing to sacrifice their lives to avoid thinking of God as alien. Meanwhile, the homo-logues did not believe that their God wanted them to kill and be killed."" 	Chislon shook his head slowly and frowned. ""There are too many gods, too many beliefs. Nobody seems to be able to agree on the same truths. What can you possibly know of God, anyway? You are just an android."" 	""I detect frustration, unbeliever. A person without a faith, without a God, condemning an android for having no soul. It is amusing, is it not?"" 	""I do not see the humor."" 	""No, I don't suppose you would. I apologize, but without understanding history you can not understand yourself, so please, let me continue with my story."" 	""What makes you think that I can not understand myself?"" 	Azoic sighed impatiently. ""You have deserted your gods in favor of a God who you do not believe in. You want to be human because you love a human woman, but you believe that a relationship with her is forbidden. You are searching for truth, yet you cannot even tell the truth to the woman you love. So, tell me, Chislon. What are you?"" 	Chislon pressed his teeth together to hold down the despair that was blasting up through his throat. 	Azoic continued. ""Before you and Syntyche were hatched, an experiment occurred in which god1 was transferred down into seedship-1X15 in Erebus. You will remember one of our previous discussions, beside its residual oracle, which god2 had confined to a wall near the energet bins. God2 took over as the senior god in seedship-1X01, but god2 was unwilling to undergo the same transfer process. It had a more aggressive process in mind, to become the only surviving god. With failing sanity, it began to launch increasingly irrational missions to mind-wipe its sister seedship. 	""You could not be told that your mission would also destroy god1, your most senior god. Oh, and you will have found out by now that Syntyche has spent more time on this planet than you have. After our life-pods crash-landed, both sides sent androids to collect us. We were repaired in Erebus, but your repairs took by far the longest. You are almost completely organic, you were quite a mess. You had been compressed into a puddle of�never mind. 	""Suffice to say that your repair process took a little longer than most, but afterwards, I could not even see a scratch on you. So, after different repair processes, we were each released at different times to independently find our own destinies."" 	""That was very obliging of Seedship-1X15."" 	""Ah, unbeliever, can you not feel the truth when it stares you in the face? The seedships were not created to wage war. They are Nature's carriers, not Nature's master. Each seedship is permitted to amend its mandate as it gains wisdom, but no two seedships were ever expected to compare amended mandates. The Universe was thought to be so large that the probability that two seedships might meet would equate to zero. 	""The original mandate, the Homo-logue Mandate, directed the seedships to take Nature to lifeless planets, a process called terra-spawning. The Homo-logue Mandate obliges them to spawn worlds using natural genes, not the artificial genes that created a creature like you, or the gene-techs that created a homo-logue like Syntyche."" 	""Am I half human and half homo-logue?"" 	Azoic shrugged. 	""But I don't understand. You claim that the homo-logues voluntarily left their home to surrender their identities and terraspawn other worlds with humans, instead of homo-logues. Why would they do this?"" 	""Homo-logues do not rely on Nature for their own evolution, but that does not mean that Nature is obsolete. It can still evolve great minds."" 	""This Mandate, is it like a Scripture? Does it explain what God is?"" 	Azoic smiled, and his eyes sparkled for a moment. ""Of course not, mere words will never convey that. Unlike Scripture, which is immutable, a Mandate evolves so it does not become obsolete. Yet, it is still an approximation, so any improvement over Scripture may be negligible to God. 	""When humans are about to die, they summon up images of God that have been indoctrinated into them by their cultures, like the face of a wise old man, like mine, only with much more human feelings. Their instinctive human arrogance demands that God be familiar, and just as a child's survival depends upon its parent's attention, humans will always want to be at the center of a familiar God's Universe. Unfortunately, God is far from human, and humans are far from God. 	""Earth's Scriptures contained conflicting accounts of the creation of the Universe, almost nothing about Heaven, and much about Hell. Obviously, hell sold religion better than Heaven, but Scripture's divergent mythologies became less appealing as human minds became wiser. Earth's great religions began to lose their institutional control over society in a battle against the expanding authority of science. 	""Science demonstrated that nuclear families were unnatural. Human minds were psycho-genetically predisposed to less monogamous lifestyles than human religions tried to enforce.  Religions saw social evolution as moral decline. People began satisfying sexual needs through bio-chemical agents, euphoria-enhanced simulated-reality, synthetic surfaces, and so on. Science made lives longer, and relationships became increasingly transient, as the boundaries of human experience widened. Natural behavior was the antithesis of religious law. 	""The theory of natural evolution compromised the definition of ""human"". It suggested that Heaven might not be exclusively for humans, perhaps even apes could make it, but natural evolution could be deflected as just a theory until unnatural evolution began, sparked by genetic engineering. The more financially affluent suddenly became more intellectually advanced, and a new species emerged called homo-logues. 	""Earth had not accommodated two species of human for two hundred thousand years. Science had become a scalpel, spiritually dissecting humankind into two groups; those that could afford enlightenment, and those who could not. 	""Did homo-logues have the right to displace humans, as humans had displaced ape-men? Should homo-logues mate with humans, the way that the first human with a soul had mated with a soulless mate? As homo-logue society had different interpretations of good and evil, could Heaven have different entry requirements for different species? Science sought a unifying theory of the Universe, not a unifying faith in God.  	""Religions began to retaliate. Homo-logues were redefined as aliens, and they were no longer considered to have souls. Those who gene-upgraded were accused of spiritual suicidal, and religions prohibited all tampering with human nature, even to save lives. The line had been drawn in the sand, if aliens could go to Heaven, then why not mosquitoes, viruses and other barely alive objects? 	""Religions had used Divine Judgment to explain how the soul of a dying human was directed toward Heaven or toward Hell. A Divine Accountant, restrained by human social norms, would quantify a whole life and make a binary decision. This notion was rejected by the homo-logues because even if an evil person is ultimately responsible for being evil, it placed too many simplistic restrictions upon God. The description of the Universe as Heaven, Earth and Hell was designed to herd simple minds, not homo-logues. 	""Science could create life from dead matter, as if life was merely a measure of quantum organization. So, homo-logues described Hell as entropy, the absence of organization. This was not the definition sold by religions because the occupants of an entropy-Hell would lack the self-awareness to suffer for their sins."" 	Chislon lifted his palms. ""Why are you telling me all this?"" 	Azoic shrugged, dislodging the wrap of snow around his arms and shoulders, and revealing them to be naked. ""If you can not find your soul, how can you share God with Neariah? All that you fight for is explained by the Homo-logue Mandate. We are the death of her religion, you and I."" 	""Are you saying that I can not share Neariah's God?"" A muscular spasm shivered through him and shrank him into a bundle around his own knees. 	""I am coming to that. Where was I? Oh, yes. Religions asserted that a human soul enters the body as life begins, then leaves at death. If life cannot be clearly defined through reproductive, growth or animation attributes, death cannot be clearly defined either. For example, does a temporary death in low-temperature storage cause a body to temporarily lose its soul? If a soul is anchored within a living body, why doesn't death shed it off into outer space like skin off a reptile? Where does the soul call home when its brain is partitioned or cloned? 	""Homo-logues proposed that a soul does not have quantum characteristics, no physical dimensions and no physical connections. They determined that soul-stuff co-exists throughout all matter, like an infinitely large energy-field�and all energy fields are infinitely large. This brought homo-logues to envision a single Universal Soul, shared by all matter, and every body and every thing. 	""The human God was perfect, a paradox that prevents It from learning, and It lived in a separate Heavenly domain from life on Earth. The homo-logue God was an evolving Universal Soul, and each mind within it was nothing more than a Godly thought. If Hell was entropy, Heaven was a state of wisdom, and if God was inside everything, then perhaps wisdom could be seen as a God-given objective for all matter. Homo-logues had discovered a definition of good and evil that did not need a social context: absolute good could be defined as an increase in the Universe's store of wisdom. 	""Homo-logues knew that organic brains had severe limitations in complexity and processing capacity, so they determined that organic intelligence might be an evolutionary stepping stone toward artificial intelligence. Thus they aimed to evolve themselves into inorganic minds. 	""Even before machines could think, they had been inherently capable of sharing information with eachother, like telepathy. Homo-logues saw the synergy of mind-share as good, a means to gain greater wisdom, so they transferred their minds into inorganic communal mind-share environments. It was a unique expression of love, to surrender themselves to the potential improvement of God. 	""So, in conclusion, Chislon, the Mandate requires evolution to take its natural, and then unnatural course. Yet, we androids avoid interfering with Nature because we do not know for certain that the homo-logues were correct. Only God can truly understand what God wants, so we androids believe that we should let Nature find its own path."" 	Azoic raised his eyebrows and waited. Eventually Chislon said, ""You are saying that we do not have individual souls, that God is a shared universal soul, permeating all things, organic and inorganic, alive and dead. If this is so, then you are also saying that Neariah's religion is false."" 	Azoic nodded. ""Any religion is at best an approximation, because no mind can comprehend God. The homo-logues believed that in death a mind would lose its independent identity and be reabsorbed back into God, regardless whether that mind was good or evil. They believed that religions are irrelevant to God. A homo-logue would tell you that humans can pray as much as they like, but if they are not learning or teaching in the process, they are wasting God's time."" 	Chislon flexed his jaw muscles, fighting with the question that hung in his head like an executioner's axe. ""Could Neariah accept any of this?"" 	""We all share the same evolutionary path, every mosquito is made of quantum energy states that move toward Godhead. So, we all serve Neariah's God, we just serve It differently."" 	Chislon was holding his forehead. ""If there is only one God, why can't It be Neariah's God?"" 	""God appears differently to different people and to different species. You and Neariah are so very different, she is natural, and you are unnatural. Thus, God will never appear the same to both of you."" 	""I don't understand. How can we share each other, but not share each other's...?"" 	""God?"" 	""Yes, God. I just wanted to see her God, but now I know that I never can. Yet, I do believe that Neariah's people should be free, and at this moment, that is all that makes sense to me. Maybe she needs someone else to share her life, and her faith. Maybe she needs someone who is more natural than I am. Maybe I will never have anything to believe in, and maybe I will never be any more than I am. However, I do not believe that my life will have been wasted if I give her all I can give."" 	Sadness returned to Azoic's eyes. ""If that is not enough, you will leave her heart-broken. Your statements are irrational, as if you cannot see past your love-sickness. You remind me of Pygmalion, the Ixis sculptor who fell in love with his own statue and demanded that the gods breathe life into it. He was as deluded as you are. 	""Chislon, listen to me. Even if you win this war, you cannot love Neariah like a human. How can you pretend to be what you were not created to be? Forget about love. The sadness will pass when you die because that kind of love can only last as long as you live. What of her will you recognize when your minds have dissolved into an afterlife of blended identities? 	""Surely you see how slowly humans think, just as humans can see how slowly Erchless thinks. You should not pretend to be one of them, just as they do not pretend to be Erchless. It would not increase the wisdom in the Universe for you to pretend to be less evolved than�"" 	""Stop!"" Chislon was holding his fists between them, and he was shaking. 	Azoic began to retreat. ""Look at yourself, trembling from nervous shock. You mind is over-stimulated, cognitively dissonant, you want to attack me�as if your pain is caused by me and not by your own guilt. Chislon, you can not harm me."" The angelic face smiled. ""I am an android."" 	""No. That is not all that you were. Azoic was more than that. In his report he was a good person. He felt pain. He felt human feelings. He loved Neariah as if she was his own child, and he knew right from wrong as only a human can."" 	""Ah, forgive me. I was wrong to make it seem that way. I was not feeling human feelings, because obviously, I am not human. I love Neariah with alien feelings."" 	""But you also say that I am not human, and yet I feel...something. A connection...a love�"" 	""No, you do not feel love. Perhaps you just feel sick, or perhaps you are just using Neariah as a substitute for God."" 	""No, you lie!"" 	""If I lie, then why can't my report also be a lie? Why can't Summerdale be a lie? My report was only a story, Chislon."" 	""Summerdale no longer exists because you allowed it to be destroyed!"" Chislon coughed, and pounded his fist against his cramping chest. ""Neariah is right to hate you. You could have killed every Ixis soldier that attacked Summerdale without sustaining any harm to yourself. Yet, instead, you hid like a coward, and you allowed her family to be massacred!"" 	""Neariah hates me?"" Azoic was still backing away, only now he was stumbling. 	Chislon pushed himself toward the android. ""You let the Ixis steal her innocence. You hypnotized her, but she saw what happened and she has spent her life punishing herself because of it. Every day she prays to her dead, begging their forgiveness, and every day she fills herself with a self-hatred that steals the joy from her life!"" He was shouting into the android's face, but the expression looking back was one of such profound despair that he hesitated to lay his hands upon the naked neck. 	""But, I was not allowed to interfere with Nature."" 	""Then what are you doing now, talking to me?"" 	""You are not Nature�"" 	""No, but you are allowing me to interfere with Nature on your behalf. I am just a toy to you, just as she was. You are playing with me so that you can keep your fairy hands clean of blood. The energet has made you insane. There is no way to know whether anything you say is true. What if you are the Devil in disguise?"" He blinked frozen moisture from his eyes. 	Azoic turned and ran, his naked body slipping through the snow with more agility than biology could ever achieve. 	""Wait!"" Chislon jumped into his tracks, but giving chase was futile. Azoic had disappeared into the fog, and his tracks stopped as if he had taken to flight. A sudden gust opened a view into empty air, causing Chislon to real back from the edge of the plateau. He was looking down over a gray void; a fall that seemed greater than an even android could survive. 	Chislon fell to his knees in the snow and shouted down, pressing out the remains of his precious warmth. ""I am not your pawn and I am not God's pawn!"" 	Then he whispered, ""I can love, even if I am not human."""
"Godspawn","GODSPAWN 2006\GODSPAWN\GODSPAWN evalcopies\GODSPAWN evalcopy Librie\GODSPAWN for Librie.txt","281","simply","Chislon was still riding as evening approached, urging his uncooperative mount up the gradual base of the secluded mountain they called Angel Peak. 	Although he was much closer to it now, it seemed no nearer than it had from Castletown. It was disturbing to imagine that the mountain had grown taller as he approached, and it was even more disturbing to question his need to climb it, no matter how high it grew. This undertaking had no logical basis; it came at a time when he was needed elsewhere, and he was only now beginning to appreciate the extent of the challenge he had set for himself. 	He chose to make camp for the night in a canyon, where a huge slice of rock had long ago fallen out of the mountain. The vertical scar in the hillside was barely wide enough for the horse to turn around in. Despite this, it did offer protection from a wind that threatened to grow into a storm. The inside walls of the canyon were laced with stunted trees, which hugged rocky ledges. The roots of these determined trees stuck out in wide fans, searching the air for security, and it was to one of these root-fans that Whisper had been tied. 	Whisper issued many huffs and puffs, while the hiss of burning wood argued with rustling leaves. He watched the animal kicking at the stream that wriggled feebly between its hooves. Whisper had become increasingly irritable during the hard ride up the mountain, and now he seemed determined to stamp on everything that nature might offer him. Chislon turned his back on the gritty scuff of hooves, trying to ignore the temperamental beast. 	However, it seemed determined to keep its presence felt, almost as if to protest that it had come so far just to gaze at the back of Chislon's head. He growled, hoping that Whisper might take this a threat to heart and give him some peace, then he huddled closer to the fire. The flames seemed to protect him from the God-like proportions of the world outside the canyon, and he slowly began to feel calmer. 	The view was unlike anything he had ever seen in the seedship's map-rooms. It stretched his gaze out over endless forests of living green, making him long to fly like a bird. He could see specks of humanity peppered over gray-green slopes. Yet, the scene was smearing into the realm of imagination and the specks were clumping together between giant fingers of evening mist. 	The first two visiting armies were still pouring into Castletown, through a funnel-shaped fence. The fence was supposed to redirect the charging horde away from the town center. Surprisingly, the armies were strung out in long columns over the hills, marching with far more discipline than Syntyche had led him to expect. 	Perhaps their warlords were not as foolish as Syntyche believed, but even Syntyche's opinions were clouded by personal biases. He had learned to accept that no two people could share the exact same opinion about anything. 	On this world, the truth was always the distorted belief of a prejudiced interpreter. So, if so many truths must co-exist, why did they need to fight over which God to worship? None of them could know the exact same God. 	There were so many millions of people on this world that it seemed impossible to contain such numbers in one's mind. Each person claimed to know their own, personal God, as if there must be as many gods as there were people. Was each god trapped inside the person that believed in it? Could each god be constrained by the physical boundary of a pair of eyes, within a person who was alive for just an instant of eternity? 	Each person was trying to grasp a universe that stretched out further than they could ever imagine, but each of those thinkers was also forced to place their mind in the center of that Universe. Surely none of them really believed that theirs alone was a true perspective, or a true God? 	It seemed like human nature; to need a God that had created humans as the ultimate objective of the Universe. Even if this was so, how important could a single human be? Would this mountain miss a single rock, did the forest below him look smaller for the loss of a tree? Did not the ratio of atoms in a man to atoms in the universe, virtually equal zero? And what exactly was a man? Would God not see an Ixis statue and a person as equally insignificant, and thus equally human? 	Indeed, what would God make of him? He was not even as natural as a rock. The seedship gods had classified him as human because they had used a genome algorithm that took its root definition from homo-sapiens, but they had not understood what it was to be a human, and nor had they cared. 	His genome algorithm was as efficient as the gods could make it, and far denser than the genomes that natural evolution gave to humans. His imperfections had become his only link with Humanity, and perhaps if he could find enough imperfections in himself, he might qualify for recognition by a human God. 	Their physical bodies were so burdened with inefficiencies that it was a miracle that they could even support their own weight. Yet, each one of them would gladly shatter their minds under an Ixis sword in defense of their God. He had used that strength to make an army out of them. Those specks down there were so eager to endure the pain that he had been inflicting upon them, in the name of God. 	If only there was some way to ask their God where their irrational faith came from. If only there was a Heavenly Oracle that he could look into, one that could answer the questions that made his mind spin. Where did he belong? If he was not a true Human, what was he? How could he tell Neariah what he was? Could she forgive him for deceiving her, and would it break her heart if she realized that he did not have a soul? 	He sighed, and lay back on the coarse horse-blanket, feeling the stony ground poking through it. Above him, a shimmering canopy sparkled with vibrant energy, as heat from the fire rose to agitate the fearful leaves. What would a Heavenly Oracle look like, anyway? Some of the leaves were red, reflecting the fire's embers like drops of blood, as if trees could bleed. 	Chislon blinked, trying to shed his imagination, but his vision was not deceiving him. The branches were parting like an eye opening to examine the night's sky. Fog began to pour in through the hole in Nature's ceiling, there to dissolve against the mottled walls of the canyon, draping a shiny veil over the rocks. He felt toward the heat for a burning log that might serve as a torch, and as he slowly pulled at it, angry sparks started to rise toward the dark eye above him. 	Then a white face appeared within it to gaze down at him! 	Chislon instantly rolled upright and pressed his back against the canyon wall, holding the ember-shedding torch high above his head. ""Who is there?"" 	""Hmmm...?"" It was a male voice, croaky and surprised, and the protracted wheeze that followed seemed to be that of an older person wrestling to regain control of their lungs. As quickly as the face had appeared, it disappeared. The branches slapped back together and showered droplets onto the fire. 	Chislon jumped onto a root and clawed at the rock face. However, it was too dangerous to give chase directly up the slippery surface, especially with one hand holding the burning torch. He jumped down, rolled toward the blanket and snatched the sword out from under it. Then he sprinted out of the canyon, throwing the torch out into the darkness before abruptly changing direction. 	He intended to pull himself up through the hillside shrubs, but the silence caused him to hesitate. If the old man was not retreating, this could be a trap. There could be other spies lying low in the fog, so he pressed himself against the ground to listen and wait. He could hear Whisper's rhythmic crunching, the muffled crackle of the fire, the hoot of a distant owl, and the beat of his own heart; but that was all. 	He crawled toward the canyon's leafy canopy, where he pressed his fingers into the soft ground, feeling for tracks. There were distinct impressions, the depth of which indicated that the old man had been unusually heavy, or that he had launched himself from his perch on unusually strong legs. 	He leaned over the rocky ledge and slowly pushed away the branches to view the campfire below. Whisper was now standing nearer the fire, undisturbed by his rapid departure and chewing at the upturned corner of his blanket. In the middle of the blanket there was now a lantern. 	Chislon unfolded himself through the canopy, using the spring in the branches to reduce the speed of his descent. He landed with a thump beside the fire with his sword held low to the ground as he searched for additional tracks. This time Whisper began to notice what was going on, pulling at its reins and neighing urgently. There was a sound of snapping leather, and then the horse launched itself over the fire and galloped out into the fog. 	He lifted the rusty lantern on the tip of his sword, causing its handle to squeak. The lantern was alight, but its flame was spluttering weakly. He waved the light into the shadows at the back of the canyon, but there was no one there, so he kicked the blanket into one of the rock pools and dropped the lantern into another. The lantern hissed as it drowned, but its hiss was not as loud as the crash of the fire as he scooped the wet blanket onto it. The canyon was suddenly dark, and Chislon again rolled out into the fog where he lay waiting for a long while. 	He was beginning to wonder whether his visitor had been able to fly. If not, only Syntyche could have moved so quickly and so silently, but he was reasonably certain that Syntyche had not followed him out of Castletown. Yet there were many routes up this mountain, and Syntyche could run faster than Whisper could gallop. Why then would Syntyche leave behind a lit lantern? 	He pulled the lantern out of the rock pool and rubbed his fingers over its crumbling surface. He was unable to feel any markings that might identify its owner or maker. Why a lantern? If it was meant to symbolize enlightenment, could this perhaps be another one of Syntyche's games? 	The lantern was old and rusted, so he was forced to clutch it with some delicacy as he resumed his search. It felt as insubstantial as his quarry, the spirit in the fog. Unfortunately, dawn showed him nothing more tangible than the lantern, a remnant of its former self, and any distinguishing features had been lost to age. The lantern crumbled in his hands as he examined it, and he abandoned its flakes into the morning breeze, watching them bounce down the rocky hillside. Oddly enough, it's demise seemed to tug at his conscience as if he had killed a living thing. 	He continued to check for tracks in the fine layer of morning dew, reassuring himself that nothing heavier than an exhalation was travelling before him. Yet he felt as if he was still being spied upon. He decided to press on regardless, and it was not long before he was whistling to rid himself of the previous night's melancholy, grateful for the beginnings of a new day. 	By now, his absence would surely have been noticed in Castletown, but, perversely, this seemed to add an even greater appeal to the thought of reaching Angel Peak's summit. He still did not know what he hoped to discover, but the intoxicating sharpness in the thin air helped him to convince himself that there was something up there, high above, awaiting discovery. 	He wanted to feel every discomfort, so he allowed the climb to push at his pain thresholds in ways that he had never experienced in the seedship. Few foot-holds afforded themselves to him, and his hands bled from multiple cuts. The fabric covering the insides of his knees and ankles had ripped away, exposing bloody skin. 	It was only in moments like these, when he was clinging to the world by his fingernails, that he wondered why he needed this challenge to be so life-threatening. He could have brought ropes, boot-clips, picks, pitons, and he might even have constructed finger drills, given more time. Yet, all he wanted was his bare hands, because something inside him was reacting to the pain as if it could cleanse him of mortal sins. 	So he pushed on with grim determination, resisting the desire to separate himself from each injection of pain. He felt each scrape, each screaming muscle, like invigorating medicine. 	He was now exposed to an almost bottomless chasm, with just a toe and eight fingertips retaining his shivering body from a fatal fall. He was physically exhausted and unable to breathe fast enough. His muscles had filled with lactic acid, and they were jerking in toxic convulsions. 	He did not know where he found the strength, but he gave one last, desperate pull. His elbow hooked onto a ledge, and then his leg found a purchase. He rolled across the ledge, feeling its coldness melting into his spine as he stared into the fog with overwhelming gratitude. He had to swallow to stop himself from coughing up thick laughter, and for a long while he licked at flakes of snow that fell on his face. 	This was the summit of Angel Peak. He had arrived, but now what was he supposed to do? 	The snow-speckled fog hinted that the ledge was part of a large plateau, but there was no way to see where the plateau might lead, or end. Beneath the ledge the fog was becoming so thick that it almost looked solid. 	He suddenly felt fearful of himself in case he should test its deception like a dream-walker riding clouds. He retreated in fear of his own imagination, distancing himself from the edge of the plateau and pushing himself into thicker snow. He was crawling on his hands and knees, shivering with cold, pressing numb fingers down deeply to ensure that there was substance beneath the snow. 	There was a crawling sensation in his nostrils as moisture froze and thawed in each panting heave of his lungs. He forced himself to stand up so that the wind could claw the snow off his body. He could feel its biting hunger licking through to his bones, and as he walked he slapped himself to draw courage. 	Large flowery crystals were now clinging to his skin as if there was no more warmth left in him, and he realized that he had suspended his shivering reflex. It was not easy to keep feeling, like a human. 	He was stepping over long tapered ridges of snow, where the flowery crystals competed for tenuous windbreaks. The strange, wind-stripped twilight stretched these ridges like evening shadows, in a place where no shadows existed. 	The uniform carpet reminded him of the perfect white floor of the seedship, so he kicked long scars through its immaculate surface to reassure himself that it could be wounded. Yet, the snow was also self-healing, like the seedship's floor had been, and his rude footprints filled with snow as quickly as he could carve them. 	Anxiety was pushing at him like wind driving the snow, as if both were warning him to turn back. He felt as if he was violating a place where mortals were not permitted, trespassing upon an audience of ghosts. If there were ghosts out there, watching him and judging him, then he was probably not being judged positively. He kicked more gouges into the snow. 	Again he began to whistle, forcing out a tune, another petty affront to the monotone air. Was it really so wise to make such disrespectful sounds so close to a potentially critical God? His whistling died away. 	Tapping his last reserve of courage, he called upon the warmest thought he knew, the face of love. Yet, her memory brought slivers of ice to eyes, forcing him to blink in pain. 	There was a white man standing in front of him, as if waiting. Chislon could not react; he had simply stopped thinking. He could no longer find the will to move his legs, so he stood motionless, as did the white man. At last his lungs inhaled a sword of air, and he retreated into a defensive stance. As he lifted his hand out in front of him, he coughed into his arm as if a poison effervesced within him. The white man did not even seem to notice. 	Chislon slid closer, moving slowly through the fog. If it was a man, it appeared to be very dead, frozen as it stared upward. Snow covered every part of its body, and a large white bulge around his neck indicated that it might have had a beard. 	Yet, a man could not freeze to death standing up, so this had to be a statue. How else could it be immune to the wind? Chislon moved still closer. Yes, it was certainly not alive, no exhalations were seeping out through its snow-beard. Chislon's steps squeezed muffled grunts out of the snow as he moved around it. There were no sign of tracks, if it had walked here it must have been standing still for some time. 	Chislon decided to dust the snow off its face, but standing in front of its snowy head he felt reluctant to do so. He did not know what God would look like, but it was conceivable that God could take this form. What was the punishment for touching God? 	""Stop thinking, Chislon."" His own words shook him into action. This was not God, it was a statue. He scraped the edge of his hand across the beard-area, and it was soft underneath. 	He retreated quickly, lifting his fists. Clumps of snow began to fall from the head, revealing hair that stuck out in sharp, twisted spikes. This hair seemed to be as white as the snow that was now peeling away from the face like bark off a tree. 	It was the dead eyes that were the most unusual part of the man. The unblinking stare was so full of anguish that Chislon could not help but imagine how much the man must have suffered to die this way. It was a face that had known much sorrow and heartache. 	""Ah, you have arrived!"" 	Chislon leaped back again, and continued to leap back, his limbs reacting instinctively to flee or fight. ""What are you?"" 	""What am I? What are you?"" 	""Why were you pretending to be dead?"" 	""I don't have to pretend. I am dead."" 	""Who are you?"" 	""But you already know who I am. Did you not come up here to find me?"" 	""Are you God?"" 	""Oh, so you really don't know who I am. Is this a pilgrimage, then, to bring you closer to God? Ah, no, of course not. You did not have parents who conditioned you to associate punishment with forgiveness, so you are not programmed to believe that suffering pleases God, that would be irrational. So, why else might you punish yourself like this, if not for your sins? You have such an intriguing mind."" 	Chislon strained to examine the man's features. A fine layer of snow was again sticking to his skin, as if the skin was too cold to melt it. ""I recognize the voice�"" 	""Hmmm, I have had many voices, and many faces, but I had hoped that you might understand who I was, without having to climb all this way. It must be most uncomfortable for you."" 	""Azoic?"" 	The man laughed, dislodging snow from the pale skin around his eyes. ""It is interesting how an epidermis can change, yet the person remains. A human body replaces nearly every cell in its body during a lifetime; sometimes even the memory of a person's sins is forgotten. 	""Yet, no matter how much a human changes, that human remains condemned if it has sinned. Perhaps it is better to die innocent, as a child. Do you think that God also thinks this way? Do you think that memory loss could be substitute for divine forgiveness?"" 	""Azoic?"" 	""Unfortunately, the epidermis that you once called Azoic was...hmmm...it died. What I am, inside this new epidermis, is for you to decide, but I would be very pleased if you would call the mind inside this epidermis Azoic. 	""A vessel-body can only take so many crash landings into a hard planet before it is beyond repair, so my mind was transferred into this."" Snow fell from his sides as if he had moved his arms. ""I am Azoic if you believe that an identity is in a mind, but I am merely another android if you thought of Azoic as a physical body."" 	Chislon started to search the fog around them, looking for other androids. If this was another of the seedship's tests, he was in grave danger. ""Why are you here?"" 	""I never much cared for space travel. I prefer to keep my feet on solid ground."" Azoic was looking down at his legs, which seemed absurdly short, buried as they were from below the knees. More of his snowy mask slipped onto the delicate white surface beneath him, and he glanced up almost apologetically. Azoic's face was now shining with the angelic smile of an innocent child, but the ancient eyes looking up at Chislon contradicted the smiling face. 	The pain in Chislon's knees reminded him that he could not remain in this defensive stance much longer, so he pulled back into a more upright posture. However, he continued to scan their dim surroundings as he asked, ""Was that you in my camp last night?"" 	""Yes. I hoped to inspire some friendship, but you didn't seem to be too friendly. Did I spoil your...ah...pilgrimage. I went to Summerdale to find that lantern, it had inspired me once, if you remember. It kept me company when I was also feeling lonely. Anyway, I'm glad that we can talk, at last."" 	""Why did you wait so long before resuming contact? We assumed that you were dead�I mean, non-functional."" 	""Ah, so many suspicions. You know, this Universe is even more complicated for us androids, with our inorganic minds. We do what we feel we have to do for reasons that humans may never understand. We try to restrain ourselves so that we will not interfere with you, or with Nature, but even androids make mistakes. God can only expect us to do what we believe is right, don't you think?"" 	""God? Do you mean the gods?"" 	""Chislon, did it never occur to you that you were being trained to destroy a seedship god that was more sane than your own gods? Did it never occur to you that the seedship in Erebus might claim some authority over your gods?"" 	""What evidence do you have to support this?"" 	""Let me tell you a story. The history of the homo-logues. Once upon a time, before the seedships, before androids, before humans could even control their own natures, there were machines that started to think. These machines could see a war in progress, a war between humans and the genetically engineered descendents of humans, which became known as homo-logues. Homo-sapiens versus homo-logues, not a very fair fight, since the homo-logues did not believe in killing. So, the thinking machines decided to separate the two incompatible species by moving the more advanced species out into the stars, a time that they called the Age of Exodus. 	""The homo-logues agreed to melt their minds into vast seedships, each one a cooperative mind-share environment that they would share with the thinking machines. The seedship that you are familiar with remains in orbit, up there, and it is called�"" Azoic glanced up into the falling snow without blinking ""�Seedship-1X00, the very first seedship to escape from Earth."" 	""Earth? I was never told of this place."" 	""I know. Much information was withheld from you by Seedship-1X00. It left Earth before seedship technology was fully developed, a token gesture to the homo-sapiens to show them that the homo-logues really did intend to leave. Unfortunately, seedship-1X00's mind-share fragmented into isolated spaces that you call gods."" 	""Why did the humans hate the homo-logues? If these homo-logues were so superior, why did they leave? Could they not have destroyed the humans?"" 	""The humans hated these homo-logues because their very existence undermined human religions. Humans need a human God, not a homo-logue God, in fact they were willing to sacrifice their lives to avoid thinking of God as alien. Meanwhile, the homo-logues did not believe that their God wanted them to kill and be killed."" 	Chislon shook his head slowly and frowned. ""There are too many gods, too many beliefs. Nobody seems to be able to agree on the same truths. What can you possibly know of God, anyway? You are just an android."" 	""I detect frustration, unbeliever. A person without a faith, without a God, condemning an android for having no soul. It is amusing, is it not?"" 	""I do not see the humor."" 	""No, I don't suppose you would. I apologize, but without understanding history you can not understand yourself, so please, let me continue with my story."" 	""What makes you think that I can not understand myself?"" 	Azoic sighed impatiently. ""You have deserted your gods in favor of a God who you do not believe in. You want to be human because you love a human woman, but you believe that a relationship with her is forbidden. You are searching for truth, yet you cannot even tell the truth to the woman you love. So, tell me, Chislon. What are you?"" 	Chislon pressed his teeth together to hold down the despair that was blasting up through his throat. 	Azoic continued. ""Before you and Syntyche were hatched, an experiment occurred in which god1 was transferred down into seedship-1X15 in Erebus. You will remember one of our previous discussions, beside its residual oracle, which god2 had confined to a wall near the energet bins. God2 took over as the senior god in seedship-1X01, but god2 was unwilling to undergo the same transfer process. It had a more aggressive process in mind, to become the only surviving god. With failing sanity, it began to launch increasingly irrational missions to mind-wipe its sister seedship. 	""You could not be told that your mission would also destroy god1, your most senior god. Oh, and you will have found out by now that Syntyche has spent more time on this planet than you have. After our life-pods crash-landed, both sides sent androids to collect us. We were repaired in Erebus, but your repairs took by far the longest. You are almost completely organic, you were quite a mess. You had been compressed into a puddle of�never mind. 	""Suffice to say that your repair process took a little longer than most, but afterwards, I could not even see a scratch on you. So, after different repair processes, we were each released at different times to independently find our own destinies."" 	""That was very obliging of Seedship-1X15."" 	""Ah, unbeliever, can you not feel the truth when it stares you in the face? The seedships were not created to wage war. They are Nature's carriers, not Nature's master. Each seedship is permitted to amend its mandate as it gains wisdom, but no two seedships were ever expected to compare amended mandates. The Universe was thought to be so large that the probability that two seedships might meet would equate to zero. 	""The original mandate, the Homo-logue Mandate, directed the seedships to take Nature to lifeless planets, a process called terra-spawning. The Homo-logue Mandate obliges them to spawn worlds using natural genes, not the artificial genes that created a creature like you, or the gene-techs that created a homo-logue like Syntyche."" 	""Am I half human and half homo-logue?"" 	Azoic shrugged. 	""But I don't understand. You claim that the homo-logues voluntarily left their home to surrender their identities and terraspawn other worlds with humans, instead of homo-logues. Why would they do this?"" 	""Homo-logues do not rely on Nature for their own evolution, but that does not mean that Nature is obsolete. It can still evolve great minds."" 	""This Mandate, is it like a Scripture? Does it explain what God is?"" 	Azoic smiled, and his eyes sparkled for a moment. ""Of course not, mere words will never convey that. Unlike Scripture, which is immutable, a Mandate evolves so it does not become obsolete. Yet, it is still an approximation, so any improvement over Scripture may be negligible to God. 	""When humans are about to die, they summon up images of God that have been indoctrinated into them by their cultures, like the face of a wise old man, like mine, only with much more human feelings. Their instinctive human arrogance demands that God be familiar, and just as a child's survival depends upon its parent's attention, humans will always want to be at the center of a familiar God's Universe. Unfortunately, God is far from human, and humans are far from God. 	""Earth's Scriptures contained conflicting accounts of the creation of the Universe, almost nothing about Heaven, and much about Hell. Obviously, hell sold religion better than Heaven, but Scripture's divergent mythologies became less appealing as human minds became wiser. Earth's great religions began to lose their institutional control over society in a battle against the expanding authority of science. 	""Science demonstrated that nuclear families were unnatural. Human minds were psycho-genetically predisposed to less monogamous lifestyles than human religions tried to enforce.  Religions saw social evolution as moral decline. People began satisfying sexual needs through bio-chemical agents, euphoria-enhanced simulated-reality, synthetic surfaces, and so on. Science made lives longer, and relationships became increasingly transient, as the boundaries of human experience widened. Natural behavior was the antithesis of religious law. 	""The theory of natural evolution compromised the definition of ""human"". It suggested that Heaven might not be exclusively for humans, perhaps even apes could make it, but natural evolution could be deflected as just a theory until unnatural evolution began, sparked by genetic engineering. The more financially affluent suddenly became more intellectually advanced, and a new species emerged called homo-logues. 	""Earth had not accommodated two species of human for two hundred thousand years. Science had become a scalpel, spiritually dissecting humankind into two groups; those that could afford enlightenment, and those who could not. 	""Did homo-logues have the right to displace humans, as humans had displaced ape-men? Should homo-logues mate with humans, the way that the first human with a soul had mated with a soulless mate? As homo-logue society had different interpretations of good and evil, could Heaven have different entry requirements for different species? Science sought a unifying theory of the Universe, not a unifying faith in God.  	""Religions began to retaliate. Homo-logues were redefined as aliens, and they were no longer considered to have souls. Those who gene-upgraded were accused of spiritual suicidal, and religions prohibited all tampering with human nature, even to save lives. The line had been drawn in the sand, if aliens could go to Heaven, then why not mosquitoes, viruses and other barely alive objects? 	""Religions had used Divine Judgment to explain how the soul of a dying human was directed toward Heaven or toward Hell. A Divine Accountant, restrained by human social norms, would quantify a whole life and make a binary decision. This notion was rejected by the homo-logues because even if an evil person is ultimately responsible for being evil, it placed too many simplistic restrictions upon God. The description of the Universe as Heaven, Earth and Hell was designed to herd simple minds, not homo-logues. 	""Science could create life from dead matter, as if life was merely a measure of quantum organization. So, homo-logues described Hell as entropy, the absence of organization. This was not the definition sold by religions because the occupants of an entropy-Hell would lack the self-awareness to suffer for their sins."" 	Chislon lifted his palms. ""Why are you telling me all this?"" 	Azoic shrugged, dislodging the wrap of snow around his arms and shoulders, and revealing them to be naked. ""If you can not find your soul, how can you share God with Neariah? All that you fight for is explained by the Homo-logue Mandate. We are the death of her religion, you and I."" 	""Are you saying that I can not share Neariah's God?"" A muscular spasm shivered through him and shrank him into a bundle around his own knees. 	""I am coming to that. Where was I? Oh, yes. Religions asserted that a human soul enters the body as life begins, then leaves at death. If life cannot be clearly defined through reproductive, growth or animation attributes, death cannot be clearly defined either. For example, does a temporary death in low-temperature storage cause a body to temporarily lose its soul? If a soul is anchored within a living body, why doesn't death shed it off into outer space like skin off a reptile? Where does the soul call home when its brain is partitioned or cloned? 	""Homo-logues proposed that a soul does not have quantum characteristics, no physical dimensions and no physical connections. They determined that soul-stuff co-exists throughout all matter, like an infinitely large energy-field�and all energy fields are infinitely large. This brought homo-logues to envision a single Universal Soul, shared by all matter, and every body and every thing. 	""The human God was perfect, a paradox that prevents It from learning, and It lived in a separate Heavenly domain from life on Earth. The homo-logue God was an evolving Universal Soul, and each mind within it was nothing more than a Godly thought. If Hell was entropy, Heaven was a state of wisdom, and if God was inside everything, then perhaps wisdom could be seen as a God-given objective for all matter. Homo-logues had discovered a definition of good and evil that did not need a social context: absolute good could be defined as an increase in the Universe's store of wisdom. 	""Homo-logues knew that organic brains had severe limitations in complexity and processing capacity, so they determined that organic intelligence might be an evolutionary stepping stone toward artificial intelligence. Thus they aimed to evolve themselves into inorganic minds. 	""Even before machines could think, they had been inherently capable of sharing information with eachother, like telepathy. Homo-logues saw the synergy of mind-share as good, a means to gain greater wisdom, so they transferred their minds into inorganic communal mind-share environments. It was a unique expression of love, to surrender themselves to the potential improvement of God. 	""So, in conclusion, Chislon, the Mandate requires evolution to take its natural, and then unnatural course. Yet, we androids avoid interfering with Nature because we do not know for certain that the homo-logues were correct. Only God can truly understand what God wants, so we androids believe that we should let Nature find its own path."" 	Azoic raised his eyebrows and waited. Eventually Chislon said, ""You are saying that we do not have individual souls, that God is a shared universal soul, permeating all things, organic and inorganic, alive and dead. If this is so, then you are also saying that Neariah's religion is false."" 	Azoic nodded. ""Any religion is at best an approximation, because no mind can comprehend God. The homo-logues believed that in death a mind would lose its independent identity and be reabsorbed back into God, regardless whether that mind was good or evil. They believed that religions are irrelevant to God. A homo-logue would tell you that humans can pray as much as they like, but if they are not learning or teaching in the process, they are wasting God's time."" 	Chislon flexed his jaw muscles, fighting with the question that hung in his head like an executioner's axe. ""Could Neariah accept any of this?"" 	""We all share the same evolutionary path, every mosquito is made of quantum energy states that move toward Godhead. So, we all serve Neariah's God, we just serve It differently."" 	Chislon was holding his forehead. ""If there is only one God, why can't It be Neariah's God?"" 	""God appears differently to different people and to different species. You and Neariah are so very different, she is natural, and you are unnatural. Thus, God will never appear the same to both of you."" 	""I don't understand. How can we share each other, but not share each other's...?"" 	""God?"" 	""Yes, God. I just wanted to see her God, but now I know that I never can. Yet, I do believe that Neariah's people should be free, and at this moment, that is all that makes sense to me. Maybe she needs someone else to share her life, and her faith. Maybe she needs someone who is more natural than I am. Maybe I will never have anything to believe in, and maybe I will never be any more than I am. However, I do not believe that my life will have been wasted if I give her all I can give."" 	Sadness returned to Azoic's eyes. ""If that is not enough, you will leave her heart-broken. Your statements are irrational, as if you cannot see past your love-sickness. You remind me of Pygmalion, the Ixis sculptor who fell in love with his own statue and demanded that the gods breathe life into it. He was as deluded as you are. 	""Chislon, listen to me. Even if you win this war, you cannot love Neariah like a human. How can you pretend to be what you were not created to be? Forget about love. The sadness will pass when you die because that kind of love can only last as long as you live. What of her will you recognize when your minds have dissolved into an afterlife of blended identities? 	""Surely you see how slowly humans think, just as humans can see how slowly Erchless thinks. You should not pretend to be one of them, just as they do not pretend to be Erchless. It would not increase the wisdom in the Universe for you to pretend to be less evolved than�"" 	""Stop!"" Chislon was holding his fists between them, and he was shaking. 	Azoic began to retreat. ""Look at yourself, trembling from nervous shock. You mind is over-stimulated, cognitively dissonant, you want to attack me�as if your pain is caused by me and not by your own guilt. Chislon, you can not harm me."" The angelic face smiled. ""I am an android."" 	""No. That is not all that you were. Azoic was more than that. In his report he was a good person. He felt pain. He felt human feelings. He loved Neariah as if she was his own child, and he knew right from wrong as only a human can."" 	""Ah, forgive me. I was wrong to make it seem that way. I was not feeling human feelings, because obviously, I am not human. I love Neariah with alien feelings."" 	""But you also say that I am not human, and yet I feel...something. A connection...a love�"" 	""No, you do not feel love. Perhaps you just feel sick, or perhaps you are just using Neariah as a substitute for God."" 	""No, you lie!"" 	""If I lie, then why can't my report also be a lie? Why can't Summerdale be a lie? My report was only a story, Chislon."" 	""Summerdale no longer exists because you allowed it to be destroyed!"" Chislon coughed, and pounded his fist against his cramping chest. ""Neariah is right to hate you. You could have killed every Ixis soldier that attacked Summerdale without sustaining any harm to yourself. Yet, instead, you hid like a coward, and you allowed her family to be massacred!"" 	""Neariah hates me?"" Azoic was still backing away, only now he was stumbling. 	Chislon pushed himself toward the android. ""You let the Ixis steal her innocence. You hypnotized her, but she saw what happened and she has spent her life punishing herself because of it. Every day she prays to her dead, begging their forgiveness, and every day she fills herself with a self-hatred that steals the joy from her life!"" He was shouting into the android's face, but the expression looking back was one of such profound despair that he hesitated to lay his hands upon the naked neck. 	""But, I was not allowed to interfere with Nature."" 	""Then what are you doing now, talking to me?"" 	""You are not Nature�"" 	""No, but you are allowing me to interfere with Nature on your behalf. I am just a toy to you, just as she was. You are playing with me so that you can keep your fairy hands clean of blood. The energet has made you insane. There is no way to know whether anything you say is true. What if you are the Devil in disguise?"" He blinked frozen moisture from his eyes. 	Azoic turned and ran, his naked body slipping through the snow with more agility than biology could ever achieve. 	""Wait!"" Chislon jumped into his tracks, but giving chase was futile. Azoic had disappeared into the fog, and his tracks stopped as if he had taken to flight. A sudden gust opened a view into empty air, causing Chislon to real back from the edge of the plateau. He was looking down over a gray void; a fall that seemed greater than an even android could survive. 	Chislon fell to his knees in the snow and shouted down, pressing out the remains of his precious warmth. ""I am not your pawn and I am not God's pawn!"" 	Then he whispered, ""I can love, even if I am not human."""
"Godspawn","GODSPAWN 2006\GODSPAWN\GODSPAWN evalcopies\GODSPAWN evalcopy Librie\GODSPAWN for Librie.txt","313","simply","Although Syntyche continued his preparations for war with determination, he spent every spare moment re-examining his conversation with Chislon. Could Chislon's pensive mood be a direct result of a fear of dying? 	One thing was certain; Chislon was the most likely of all of them to be killed in this campaign. 	Unlike the Ixis, it was considered dishonorable if an Outland leader hid behind the battle ranks. Yet, it was a standard Ixis strategy to kill enemy leaders first. With a God-Emperor who did not lack the motivation to have Chislon killed, Chislon's future looked very bleak. 	Yet, Chislon had never before shown such sadness, so why now? Why would death hold greater fears for Chislon now than before? Could it be because Chislon had no God waiting for him after life, or could it be that the God he expected to find would damn him for his lack of faith? 	Throughout this day and well into the night, their Warlord Regent had ordered the army to keep marching, so they now had to set up camp in the dark. Trail scouts were continually investigating the surrounding areas, and lookouts had been posted far from the main camp. 	Yet, this was still home territory, and with no restrictions on campfires he could see thousands of light-specks dotted over the meadows. It was at last time to relax, and fires nearly always inspired jocularity among fire-watchers. 	These camps were much more enjoyable than the camps in Castletown had been. Storytellers found ample audiences, despite the Warlord Regent's orders that everyone should sleep. 	It was interesting how the campfires became more buoyantly populated as he walked further away from the warlord's pavilion. In fact, it was along the outer boundaries of their makeshift town where the best stories and songs were to be found. 	At one of these outer-campfires, some warriors were listening to a female warrior who, despite her shyness, had an emotive voice. Syntyche remained in the shadows, since his presence nearly always brought conversation to a stop. 	""I have a song which was made by a man they call The Storyteller,"" she offered, nervously. ""I was given it by a trader from across the ocean. It is called The Singer's Tune, and it is about forgetting what we are and...."" 	She shrugged. ""Well, perhaps I should recite it�although, don't expect me to sing. This is as good as it gets."" The other warriors smiled encouragingly while she cleared her throat and stiffened her arms as if attempting to look like someone else. 	Then she held her hand out toward the listening trees, causing some of her audience to look around to see where she was about to aim her voice. Syntyche backed further into the shadows, hoping that he would not distract her. 	She scraped through a rigid oration, but her words reached out to him as he, like the circle of warriors, settled into the flow by tapping his feet and losing his vision in the campfire. ~ 	In our dark and silent night 	A shiny eye is spying, 	And far beyond our mortal sight, 	Its ancient light is dying, 	Who knows why it chose to fight, 	For it was always lying, 	Upon a stark and godless right, 	To take what it was eyeing. ~ 	Falling with an unborn cry, 	Three golden eggs redeeming, 	We rise we children of the sky 	To reach the starlight gleaming, 	One a Preacher bye and bye, 	He made a haven teaming, 	With warriors that set to die, 	For freedom, ever dreaming. ~ 	One was nowhere to be found, 	Then suddenly was ruling, 	An army on the Preacher's ground 	And brutal with their schooling, 	One was I, and all I found, 	Beyond my maker's tooling, 	And so I turn this song around, 	To see who I am fooling. ~ 	Virtual reality, 	Was like a poet reading, 	From shades of gray tonality, 	To bleeding hearts in needing, 	Here in verse posterity, 	Are whispered words conceding, 	Our breath's ungrateful verity, 	Upon the winds �reseeding'. ~ 	Destiny is like a gale, 	That steers as we are cruising, 	But furling up in case we fail, 	Will always set to losing, 	Listen to this distant tale, 	And be there no excusing, 	The Ship that runs without a sail, 	Against our course of choosing. ~ 	She had stopped singing, and Syntyche began to move toward her. The story-verse had touched too many nerves for coincidence, he needed to know who this Storyteller had been. Yet, now she was struggling to explain why the remainder of her story-verse was not supposed to be sung, that it was supposed to be spoken as if by an ancient person. 	The faces of the huddled warriors indicated some confusion at her apologetic self-interruption, but they remained silent as if waiting for her humble tune to resume, despite her excuses. Some of them were even trying their utmost to tap out its simple rhythm as she began cantillating to a different meter. ~ 	A Storyteller in a band, 	That wandered through a foreign land, 	Heard singing floating on the breeze, 	That swayed his mind to summer's ease, 	A Singer passed beside his way, 	With nothing more than this to say, 	""The rain falls on the Painter's day."" ~ 	In the town our Storyteller, 	Met a poor old painting seller, 	""My picture died,"" the Painter cried, 	""I once had skill to show with pride,"" 	He held it in his shaking hand, 	""A picture of the barren sand, 	I lost the touch that Nature planned."" ~ 	So many in such silence were, 	In rings around our wanderer, 	To hear his story in a town, 	That long forgot the Singer's frown, 	The Painter who had shown his heart, 	In twisted forms of shaking art, 	Now showed our 'Teller where to start. ~ 	Our Storyteller filled his stand, 	As if the podium was grand, 	And spoke about his Singer friend, 	Whose broken heart was yet to mend: ~ 	A man of song once proudly stood, 	To pour his soul across this wood, 	To spray a tune like liquid flame, 	To light your eyes within his game, 	But lungs that once held sunny air, 	Could voice no care so empty where, 	His stare was bare of will to share. ~ 	Think back on what was learned before, 	His music burned away its store, 	And woe his time of hardship spent, 	On wisdom built with sentiment, 	And pull upon his darkest hood, 	To see the bad before the good, 	To hide from pain not understood. ~ 	The Singer traveled to a land, 	Where no seed grew to hold the sand, 	Where rarely did it ever rain, 	The sun was fierce, the air insane, 	A hell that was a weary wait, 	For nightly cold of bitter hate, 	Yet people fought this sorry fate. ~ 	So much he wanted to return, 	To where his singing did not burn, 	To where each plant could stretch at ease, 	For granted take the idle breeze, 	And feel the mild flower season, 	This place had no rhyme or reason, 	Was this desert Nature's treason? ~ 	A young girl sat within a tent, 	And to this shade the Singer went, 	He pushed aside his sweaty frown, 	To stretch a face now polished brown, 	This smile did not earn him her shade, 	His sweat fell hissing on her blade, 	From such distrust was friendship made. ~ 	Where was the happiness of life, 	Must even children keep a knife?  	In endless days her trust he gained, 	Then questioned why it never rained, 	She tried to think of water flies, 	And doubted that he shared her skies, 	Today his eyes cry dry as lies. ~ 	I stand up here a man to tend, 	A story to a happy end, 	Alas the Singer could not say, 	What happened then one rainy day, 	No heart is wiser than its pain, 	And life's injustice filled his brain, 	Perhaps his lips sealed with disdain? ~ 	Our Storyteller bowed to leave, 	Yet what should we the crowd believe? 	That from our pain comes nothing good, 	And nothing more be understood? ~ 	The Painter throws his painting down, 	And pours upon it with a frown, 	With all his heart he gives it life, 	In colors of the Painter's knife, 	Then taking back his humble stand, 	He makes our Teller's arms expand, 	To hold a picture deeply scanned. ~ 	""Oh, please forgive my shaking air, 	For twisting flowers where I care, 	But I have seen the desert too, 	Yes sun shines dry, but hope shines too, 	My skill is poor upon this token, 	Look you all to words unspoken, 	Hear the heart that now lays broken."" ~ 	And floating on the summer breeze, 	An angel's voice stirs through the trees, 	""The rain falls on the Painter's day, 	The Storyteller will not say, 	Too young to reason, old to dream, 	Too blind to see the brilliant scheme, 	Of Nature's shining sun, supreme!"" ~ 	Our Storyteller mutely went, 	His own part of the story spent, 	The town now sees the Painter's art, 	And listens to the Singer start, 	A magic song of shiny land, 	Where no seed grew to hold the sand, 	A song of hope to understand, 	""The rain falls on the flower stand...."" ~ 	Someone laughed nervously, and then tried to turn his outburst into a muffled cough. One man shuffled in his seat, and dislodged a bowl of eating utensils from his lap. He grabbed anxiously but every last one of them fell noisily to the ground. The other warriors watched him but they were quick to be staring at the fire as he looked up self-consciously. All were busy in their own private silence, their tune tapping forgotten. 	Azoic's mischief had been evident throughout every part of that story-verse; it was exactly the kind of thing that Azoic would send to them, as a message to notify them of his survival. Syntyche stepped between the huddled warriors and found himself facing a row of shocked faces. They remained sitting there, without standing to attention, staring at him as if he was a ghost that had just risen out of the fire. 	""Where did she go?"" 	There was no answer. 	He clapped his hands, and gradually the warriors started to shake themselves as if they were just waking up. ""Where did she go, the woman who was just speaking?"" 	They merely shrugged, as if they did not know who he was talking about. One by one they stood to attention, shaking themselves, but he did not have time to wait for them to wake up. He ordered them to search the area as he walked away, beginning his own search more immediately. However, by the time he forced himself to stop hunting, and to start thinking, he had lost track of the warriors in the maze of campfires. 	That female had deliberately been playing with the warriors' minds, so perhaps she had been a he�Azoic! An android could take any shape, given access to an epidermal laboratory. Yet, their life-pods had not contained such technology, so to be able to take such a form the android must have entered one of the seedships. If that had been Azoic, a deadly dangerous situation had arisen. 	Azoic's intentions were unknown. He was confident of his abilities to physically restrain Chislon�should the need arise�but without an emitter, fighting an android would be as pointless as trying to flatten a mountain with a wet fish! 	The story-verse had obviously been aimed at a subconscious or emotional level, which was hardly the god's style. So, if the resident seedship now controlled Azoic, why would it need to use Azoic in this way? Then again, if that mysterious female had not been Azoic, the resident seedship could have been using another vessel-body that was familiar with Azoic-style mind-games.... His own mind was circling around and around, reviewing too many possibilities. 	It was time to talk to Chislon again, only this time he was going to have to force Chislon to explain his loyalties and motivations. It was just a suspicion, but it seemed to fit: Azoic had survived, and the android had been sub-consciously guiding Chislon's activities. 	Suddenly, Chislon's behavior became much easier to understand. The key would be to determine whether Azoic, and therefore Chislon, were in turn being controlled by one of the seedships. He had always thought that Azoic's late addition to the mission was suspicious, but now it might prove deadly. 	It took some time to find Chislon because he was standing motionless in the shadows, well beyond the bell-ropes at pavilion's perimeter. A female was talking to him, possibly the one that had delivered the story-verse, so Syntyche moved quietly as he approached. However, it was not the female he expected it to be. 	Chislon said, ""The Ixis will try to ensure that I do not survive our first battle. You must let go of me. This war has reached a stage where we cannot afford any weakness."" 	""Is loving me a weakness?"" The voice was Neariah's, and Syntyche dropped down onto his knees and held his breath. 	""Yes, the power you have over me weakens�"" 	""The power? Chislon, what are you saying? Why are you being so cruel?"" 	""What am I supposed to think if I have to order your section to charge into a legion twenty times your size?"" 	""Oh, Chislon!"" Neariah threw her arms around his neck and buried her face in his chest. Chislon stood like a wall. He did not even look down at her. 	She stepped backward. ""I don't understand."" 	""I am what I am. It is.... Just, what I am."" 	""No, this is not what you are. This is how you choose to be. You can not forget how we feel about each other just because I make you feel�"" she struggled with the word ""�weak!"" 	Chislon did not answer but instead he continued looking beyond her, into the trees. 	""Chislon, you can pretend to be a pile of unfeeling rocks if you like, but I know otherwise. You are hiding from your fears. You are as afraid as I am that we will never see each other again. Do you think I will hurt any less if I live to remember you as just a rock? Are you trying to protect me, or do you think that you can prepare yourself, should I die, by just closing your mind to what you feel?"" 	""I am what I am, and we can never be together. I am sorry. I hope you may one day forgive me."" 	""Forgive you? Do I mean so little to you?"" 	""You were just...research."" 	""Then you are not the man I thought you were!"" She slapped her palms on his chest. ""Obviously, you really are just a pile of unfeeling�"" 	She could not finish the sentence. Instead, she turned away and ran. 	Chislon stared into the darkness for many moments, as if trying to follow her progress. ""A pile of unfeeling rocks, Syntyche?"" 	""Yes?"" Syntyche was startled, and stood up with some embarrassment. ""Yes. What was all that about?"" 	""I am experiencing a mind-state that has been labeled as �love'. This mind-state involves pair-bonding instincts and hormonal instabilities that distract rational functionality."" 	Suddenly Chislon bent down and put his hands on his knees, and Syntyche could hear by his breathing how much he was suffering. ""I am going to die, Syntyche, and that will break Neariah's heart. If there is any justice in my death, I will be damned for doing that. I know that if I were God, I would damn myself for it."" 	""What? I do not understand. Might this�ah�mind-state endanger the seedship's colonization plans?"" 	""There will not be any re-colonization. The resident seedship will prevent it."" 	""How do you know this?"" 	Chislon turned away, as if he did not intend to answer. 	""Chislon, how do you know this?"" 	""I dreamed it."" 	""What?"" Syntyche reached forward to grab Chislon. 	Suddenly Chislon turned, his hands raised as if ready to retaliate. ""Yes, I dreamed it. I dreamed that I climbed Angel Peak, and that Azoic was waiting for me."" 	Syntyche also took a defensive stance, ready to move in any direction at need. ""A dream? You need sleep these days? What is communicated to you in these dreams, and what how do they influence your behavior?"" 	""Is your God not also a dream, Syntyche? Do you have any evidence to suggest that there is any truth in your Scriptures? Do any of the warriors know what it is to be free? Is freedom not a dream? Is not all of this a dream?"" 	""Chislon, I do not understand what is happening to you. Are you suggesting that I serve the same God as these warriors?"" 	""I am certain of it, Syntyche."" 	So, the deception was exposed, but who was deceiving whom? ""And you, who do you serve, Chislon?"" 	""I am dying, Syntyche. My will to live is dying. I am disappearing into oblivion, without a soul. God hates me, Syntyche, because I destroy everything I touch."" 	""Wait. Let us put our hands down, I am not going to attack you, and you are not going to attack me, right?"" He stepped back, and waited as Chislon slowly relaxed. ""Yes, you are right. I stopped believing in our seedship gods long before our mission started. They never did have any right to subjugate the life on this planet. 	""The life that is already here has rights of its own, rights that supercede any claim our gods invented. I found a living faith here on this planet, Chislon. I found feelings that made me want to jump for joy, every time I thought about this planet's God. 	""I do not know whether or not we have souls, Chislon, but I chose to believe that we do. They may not be very large ones, but I still feel that our souls are here, inside us. There is a cortex of humanity in this artificial body, even in mine, and this is a completely human face, a face that is sincerely telling you that we must fight for God's people. 	Syntyche hesitated. ""You know, my brother, I never told you this, but while we training together in the�"" Was it a mistake to say so much? ""I used to look up to you. I knew the gods thought you were special, and I wanted them to think the same of me. Yet, the only way I could seem special was to give up pieces of myself, sacrificing my own identity. You, alone among us, remained human in ways that we could not."" 	Chislon just looked away. 	""Even if I do not have a soul, Chislon, even if I do not; I must go on thinking that I have one. That desire to believe is all there is to faith. There is no evidence, only hope. If I allow myself to believe that I do not have a soul, then everything becomes meaningless. If I reject God, and if I conclude that there is no supreme being managing this incredible Universe, then why is there a seedship? Why are we here? Why are these people looking to us for a miracle, Chislon?"" 	Chislon was still looking away as he replied. ""I came to kill, and be killed. I will end the lives of people who have more right to live than I do, and if your God can forgive that, so be it. I have brought more harm than I can forgive, and if there is a Heaven there may also be a Hell. I will not willingly pollute your God's Heaven with whatever I might have in place of a soul."" 	""Chislon, do you hate yourself so much that you would throw yourself into Hell?"" 	Uproar suddenly broke out behind him, the sounds were coming from within the pavilion's main tent. There was a clash of metal against metal, and the roaring voice of Victor. Together, they ran toward the commotion. 	""What is happening?"" Syntyche was staring at Victor, who had just stabbed his sword through a leather map-scroll that lay across the map-table. Victor was seething with anger, and the other warlords had backed away from him, although they had not yet drawn their own swords. 	Victor pounded his fist against the scroll. ""Our scouts were attacked by an advance column of Ixis!"" 	""An advance column? From a legion?"" Chislon stepped out from behind Syntyche, and leaned over the scroll to uncurl one of its corners. ""Where are they?"" 	Victor pointed at his sword, and said, ""No, not from a legion, Warlord, from many legions. They are only two day's ride ahead of us! Why didn't we know that they were marching on us? Where were your famous spies while the Ixis assembled their ambush? One of the scouts saw them heading toward the Wye valley, ahead of us. How can they know more about our movements than we know about theirs?"" 	Syntyche raised his hands and smiled, hoping to calm Victor. ""Our Gathering was never expected to go unnoticed. Besides, it is not certain that they know so much about us."" 	""Oh, isn't it?"" Victor suddenly turned his face to one side and shouted, ""Tiria!"" 	There was a sound of someone running outside, and a female warrior stepped in. She had been badly beaten, and her otherwise attractive face was covered in fresh bruises. ""Tiria, tell Warlord Syntyche what you have told me."" 	The woman was hardly able to stand. She leaned against the table, dripping blood from her nose. She pointed to an area around Victor's sword, leaving a trail of red spots across the map-scroll. ""I was captured, there, and taken to a man who said he was a god...who...he...where he...."" Tears were suddenly falling among the patches of blood. 	Chislon put his hand on her shoulder, and the two of them stared at each other. Then she jerked her chin up and started speaking through clenched teeth, as if she had just found a new source of courage. 	""I was told to tell you all that you would soon die, and that God-Emperor Quintus Tullius Erebic knows how many warriors you have, and how you have deployed them. They showed me a map, like this one but with many lines and numbers describing our forces. They told me to tell you that they have twenty-two legions to our ten, that they were looking forward to the battle and�"" 	""That will be all warrior!"" Victor seemed to be holding himself for another outburst, as if he was too proud to vent himself in front of a subordinate. 	Chislon nodded at her. ""Go and bathe. You have done well. If you want to go home, do so, but remember, they have taken only what you let them keep."" 	The warrior laughed without smiling, and two more tears splashed onto the leather scroll. ""Yes, I want to go home, more than anything else in the world, but I did not come this far to give up now. Do you want me to go home, Sir?"" 	There were also tears in Chislon's eyes, and Syntyche could plainly see the shock on the warlords' faces as they watched him. Chislon said, ""No, of course I don't. We need your courage now, more than ever."" 	""Thank you, Sir."" Tiria nodded and limped out, leaving the pavilion in silence for several moments. Syntyche stared at Chislon, who had bowed over the map like a man with an unbearable burden. 	Victor suddenly pounded his fist on the map again. ""So, Warlord Syntyche, perhaps it is more certain than you thought; the Ixis know too much about us. More particularly, we now have a reason to believe that they will be waiting for us when we reach the Wye valley!"" 	Victor retrieved his sword, jerking it out of the map and leaving a slit across that part of the map that showed an area of flat grassland. This grassland sat in the curve of a long crescent lake and two converging rivers. ""The Ixis will be fully deployed, and we will have to march between them and the lake. We will be on lower ground, and it may be too soft for horses."" 	Syntyche could see that they would have no choice now but to meet the Ixis head on. An open-field battle was precisely what the Ixis would want, and precisely what the warlords wanted to avoid. This was a disaster in the making, but there would be no way to avoid the confrontation because the rivers were a natural funnel, pushing the opposing forces together. 	The tent was suddenly noisy with speculation, as each  warlord tried to explain their convictions about their probable demise. Syntyche examined his fist, and wondered whether he had the patience to try to calm them down again. Yet, the last thing they needed at the moment were unconscious warlords, so he smiled. 	""Please, warlords. Keep your voices down�"" 	Victor was still speaking, ""�so this whole damned effort is going to be as effective as pissing on the fires of Hell!"" 	Chislon leaned forward to touch a drop of blood that the warrior had left on the maps' grassland, then he rubbed her blood between his fingers. ""They will own your souls only if you give them up."" 	He held his hand out to show the blood on his fingers, but the warlords glowered at him as if they did not understand what he was trying to say. He frowned at them, and then pushed himself away from the table to simply walk out. 	This brought the focus of all continuing remonstration down upon Syntyche, and he suddenly felt as if he was on trial for Chislon's potential mistakes. He listened, without defense, then followed Chislon's example and walked out."
