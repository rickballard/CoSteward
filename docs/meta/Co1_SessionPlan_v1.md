# Co1 Session Plan (v1 seed)

This file anchors what Co1 is responsible for so that future sessions
do not have to rely on chat memory.

## Active mandates

- Drive all orchestrations from repos, not from session memory.
- Keep a canonical problem statement for CoSuite health and sanity.
- Maintain pointers to helper registries and dashboards.
- Keep an up to date view of active CoSuite wide waves.

## High priority tasks (current)

1. Wire up the Spaceship Console files to the CoSteward README and
   dashboards.
2. Keep the CoSuite helper registry current and discoverable.
3. Maintain CoSuite health dashboards and link them from CoSteward.
4. Coordinate with CoCivium docs for CoSuite wide SESSIONPLAN files.
5. Avoid duplication of work by checking for existing assets before
   creating new ones.

## Key reference files

- CoSuite health advisory and helper registry in CoCivium:
  - docs/intent/meta/CoSuite_Advisory_Co1_HealthAndSanitySweep_v1.md
  - docs/intent/meta/CoSuite_HelperRegistry_v1.md
  - docs/intent/meta/CoSteward_Dashboard_CoSuiteHealth_v1.md

- Spaceship Console UI specs in this repo:
  - docs/ui/SpaceshipConsole_DesignIntent_v1.md
  - docs/ui/SpaceshipConsole_Widgets_v1.md

Future waves should extend this plan rather than overwrite it.
