# MW CoCheck Wave1 v1 – Scaffolding

This wave seeds the CoCheck mission into CoSteward/docs/product.

- Establishes `CoCheck` as a named session.
- Seeds a short product need/spec stub.
- Creates a home folder: docs/product/MW_CoCheck_Wave1_v1/

You can later replace or expand these stubs with the fuller spec and design docs.
