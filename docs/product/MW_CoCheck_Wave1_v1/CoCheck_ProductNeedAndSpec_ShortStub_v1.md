# CoCheck – Product Need & Spec (Stub v1)

CoCheck is a user-owned, non-commercial reading lens and trust layer that:

- strips clutter from media articles,
- summarizes core claims and takeaways,
- surfaces commercial/political/worldview bias patterns,
- estimates time/attention saved,
- and aggregates rolling merit/rep metrics (e.g., MeritRank, RepTag) for outlets/authors.

Core modes (short):
- Quick & Concise (default)
- Verbose & Exploratory
- Original Voice (preserve author style, cleaned & checked)
- Favorite Writer Emulation (optional, within ethical bounds)

Economic stance:
- No ads, no pay-for-better scores, no paid trust badges.
- Donations (if any) flow only via CoCivium, under anti-capture governance.

This stub is a placeholder; future waves should replace it with a full PRD and design docs.
