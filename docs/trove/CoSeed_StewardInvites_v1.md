## Intent

Establish a small 'Seed Steward Circle' of 3–7 individuals from
pay-it-forward / open-source / civic-tech communities who can:

- provide perspective and sanity checks on CoCivium / CoGibber / CoStart,
- act as early moral and conceptual anchors,
- optionally become donors or introducers to donors,
- optionally become long-term contributors or advisors.

This is a private, invite-only circle; not a public launch or endorsement.

## Archetypes

- Old-School OSS Maintainer
- Standards / Protocol Greybeard
- Civic / Philanthropy Bridge
- Ethical Pragmatist (ethics + implementation)

Future Co1 waves can hang real names under these archetypes.

## Offer

- Early look at CoGibber + CoStart + CoAnchor rails.
- Clear, bounded ask (eg 60–90min call + occasional email).
- No obligation to endorse publicly.
- Optional path to advisor / donor / patron roles if it resonates.

## Dependencies

This invite pattern assumes:

- CoAnchor Quickstart v2 and Moonshot v2 bootstrap/BPOE advisories
  are canon in CoSteward.
- CoGibber trigger-word v1 design exists as internal trove.
- CoIndex can act as reference client for CoBus/CoGibber/CoGbx v1.

## Next steps (for Co1 / CoPrime)

- Propose 3–7 candidate individuals matching the archetypes.
- Draft a one-page 'early steward' invite template.
- Stage outreach as private, 1:1 conversations before any public
  launch wave for CoGibber / CoStart.
