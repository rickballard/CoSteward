# CoTabBoot – quick fix for sticky AI tabs

When an AI chat tab feels slow or unresponsive, try CoTabBoot before restarting
the whole browser or computer.

## How to CoTabBoot (Windows)

1. Click the laggy AI tab to make sure it has focus.
2. Press Ctrl+W once to close that tab.
3. Immediately press Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen the last closed tab.

## How to CoTabBoot (macOS)

1. Click the laggy AI tab.
2. Press Cmd+W once.
3. Press Cmd+Shift+T to reopen the last closed tab.

If the browser supports session restore, your chat should reappear and often feels
more responsive.

If CoTabBoot does not help, move up to the heavier hygiene tools described in the
CoSteward Ops Manual (SessionPurge and CoReload).
