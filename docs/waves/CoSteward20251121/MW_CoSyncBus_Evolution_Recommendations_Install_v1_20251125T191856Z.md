- Provide suggestions for multi-session awareness, overlap detection and advisory routing.
- Treat this doc as a living BPOE rail for CoSync rather than a one-off note.

Next steps:
- Co1 session: ingest this doc and map items into lanes and missions.
- Other sessions: reference this doc when proposing changes to CoSync behaviour.
