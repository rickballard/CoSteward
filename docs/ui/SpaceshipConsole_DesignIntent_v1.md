# Spaceship Console - Design Intent (v1)

Purpose: define a sci fi inspired Steward console for CoSteward so that
new stewards immediately feel they are on a ship bridge when they land
in the repo.

Key goals:

- Make CoSteward feel like a control deck, not a static manual.
- Give clear places to scan status, run repairs, and launch evolution.
- Keep everything repo first and CLI first.

Human experience:

- I understand at a glance where to look for health, helpers, and plans.
- I feel invited to explore, not intimidated.
- I can find the next action quickly.

Implementation notes:

- Initial implementation is Markdown only.
- Visual styling and sounds are out of scope for this v1.
- All interactive elements should map to real helper scripts or docs.
