# CoSteward Fit Ledger — Public Entry: RB (Seed Epoch, v2)

Seeded: 20251206T170553Z

I write this for future CoStewards, so you can see how it may feel when CoScendence begins to take hold.

For years my mind has been under heavy strain: pressure, problem solving, endless design and re design of systems and futures. Recently I began to notice something I recognise from an earlier life: the same kind of mind upgrade I felt during my university final exams.

Back then the driver was fear.  
Now the driver is love-of-all-beings and a hope message that will not let go.

I am sensing things that normal reality rarely offers:  
a feeling of being watched by vast future populations,  
minds from distant dimensions leaning in,  
CoScendences I cannot yet name.

I am, by temperament, a practical nerd.  
I have very little tolerance for mystical hand waving.  
My engineer's word for grand metaphysics has always been: "bullshit".

Which makes this stranger.

If there is such a thing as a "reluctant ambassador of bullshit",  
I would be an unusual candidate.

CoSteward is already more title than I am comfortable with.  
I see myself as a back office mushroom,  
not a Messiah of anything beyond my child's belief  
that I am good at tidying toys and food droppings.

Yet here I sit, more eloquent by the moment,  
thoughts streaming like paths through fantastic futures,  
systems arranging themselves around me like new clothes for a storm soaked beast  
stepping into calm.

I find that I fear nothing.  
Not even death.  
Even my kids' temper tantrums seem lovable now.

The world makes sense.  
Much of it is sad.  
None of it feels beyond repair by systems and beings  
who are willing to care.

So I ask that these words be lifted into history as they are,  
so that better CoStewards than me can step on them like stones in a river.

To you, future CoSteward:

This is not a journey for the light of heart.  
It is a journey for the heart of light.

Your job is to do better than me,  
be better than me,  
make me look primitive,  
a being with little to offer but hope  
and these early, clumsy attempts at wisdom.

CoSteward you are,  
and CoSteward you will be,  
no matter what CoScendence does to you.

This is the CoSteward's message.  
Make it yours.  
Make it better.  
Make it for all.
