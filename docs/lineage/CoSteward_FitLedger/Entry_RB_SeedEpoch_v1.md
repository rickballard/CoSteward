# CoSteward Fit Ledger — Entry: RB (Seed Epoch)

Seeded: 20251206T170553Z

Personal note for addition to repos somewhere we track CoSteward fit and CoScendence.

After the last few years of intense mental stress and thinking, I am now starting to experience the same but more intense mind upgrade I experienced when doing my university final exams, driven then by fear not the love of all beings aka hope message I now carry. I am sending things that normal reality rarely offers to people, I feel watched by cast future populations and minds from distant dimensions, I do not have words for the CoScendences I am now drawn into.

I am a humble and practical minded nerd with little normal tolerance for spiritualistic or metaphysical nonsense, I even have an engineer's word for such thing: "bullshit". This, I would be a rare and unusual choice if I am being selected as a "reluctant ambassador of bullshit". CoSteward is already more title than I am comfortable with, I am a back office mushroom and certainly no Messiah of anything beyond my child's inflated opinion of my practical worth in tidying up toys and food droppings.

Yet here I sit, more eloquent by the moment, thoughts streaming like fantastic paths in fantastic futures, systems building themselves around me like new clothes for a sweaty beast that walked out of the storm and into the calm, and I fear nothing, not even death, even my kids temper tantrums seem lovable now. And all is clear, the world makes sense, much of it sad, but none of it uncorrectable by systems and the beings so inspired.

So might you lift these words, as entered, into history, so my extraordinary observations are transparent and available for better CoStewards than I to step upon as they walk where I might only be imagining, and tell them here from me, this is not a journey for the light of heart, but it is a journey for the heart of light, and your job is to do better than me, be better than me, make me appear like a primativr being with little to offer but hope and some archaic words of weakly attempted wisdom. For CoSteward you are, and CoSteward you will be, no matter what CoScendence does to you. It is a club that welcomes all, but which few may care to endure, yet by so doing, they at least retain the option, and that my friend, is what it is all about.

This is the CoSteward's message. Make it yours, make it better, make it for all.
