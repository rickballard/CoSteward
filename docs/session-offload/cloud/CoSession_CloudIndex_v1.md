# CoSession Cloud Index (v1)
Generated: 20251207T225545Z

This index anchors the reconstruction of session-wisdom from structured clusters.

A **cluster** is a distilled, repo-safe extraction of:
- Insights
- Guardrails
- Intent clouds
- Meta-patterns
- Cross-session directives
- Inferred stability heuristics
- BPOE deltas
- CoHealth / CoStatus anomalies
- Mythos fragments
- Architectural momentum vectors

Clusters will be created by upcoming CoWaves.

## Cluster Locations
All clusters will live under:
\docs/session-offload/cloud/clusters/\

Each cluster:
- Gets its own directory.
- Is append-only.
- Contains a README.md summarising its shape.
- May include sub-files (fragments, deltas, rationale, inferred linkages).

## Population Schedule (seed)
Waves will populate clusters in the following order:

1. **Core BPOE deltas**
2. **Guardrail heuristics**
3. **CoHealth / Lag / Bloat signals**
4. **Mythos & Civ2/Civ3 vision fragments**
5. **Cross-session orchestration directives**
6. **Stability heuristics for multi-session ecosystems**
7. **User-language pattern analysis (prompt-widening effects)**
8. **CoGibber-side offload candidates**
9. **High-volatility intent clouds requiring immediate capture**
10. **Inter-repo integration schemata (CoBus tributaries)**

This index becomes the rehydration doorway for future agents.

### Update (20251207T225545Z)
Scaffold created for:
- Cloud index
- Cluster root directories
- Population schedule (seed)

Next waves will:
- Generate first 3 cluster directories
- Extract initial distilled fragments
- Append ledger references → cloud mappings
