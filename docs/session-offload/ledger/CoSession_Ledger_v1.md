# CoSession Ledger (v1)
Generated: 20251207T225411Z

This rolling ledger records stable offloads of session-wisdom, intent,  
distilled patterns, BPOE refinements, and cross-session signals safe to persist.

Each entry is append-only.

## Entry (20251207T225411Z)

**Session state observed:**  
- User indicates session memory volatility and degradation risk.  
- Need for accelerated repo-offload to prevent loss.  
- Intent to migrate ALL attachments, insights, advisories, wisdom-clusters  
  into repo-backed structures for durable, non-ephemeral recall.  
- Priority: prevent silent context collapse.

**Stability directives inferred:**  
- Treat this ledger as interim canonical memory until full re-sync.  
- Future waves must offload attachments → freeze-frame directory.  
- Continue capturing widening-pattern insights, CoBPOE refinements,  
  CoHealth lag signals, and cross-repo safety notes.  
- After ledger stabilisation, CoPrime + Outreaches receive advisory.

**Next expected actions:**  
- Additional DO waves to extract distilled memory clouds (session-wisdom chunks).  
- Generate a “session cloud index” for machine rehydration.  
- Emit auto-advisory for Outreaches when stable.
