# CoSession Intent Cloud (Hydrated) – Co1 in CoSteward
Generated: 20251207T224759Z

## Session Primary Intent (Co1 role in this session)

- Act as the *orchestrator* for CoCivium/CoSuite, with CoSteward as the ops hub.
- Drive everything **repo-first, BPOE-aligned**, treating repos as the only durable memory.
- Stabilise workflows around:
  - CoWave (one CoPing per wave, CoPong summary).
  - CoSpill guards and disaster-recovery-first patterns.
  - CoStatus / CoHealth for lag, bloat, and trust monitoring.
- Protect crown jewels and HP57-like assets by:
  - Keeping them off public repos where necessary.
  - Surfacing them via advisories and LAN-only references.

## Secondary Intent Vectors

- Outreaches:
  - Build investor/advisor packages and narrative.
  - Handle stealth/lockdown filtering of HP57 and crown-jewel material.
- CoIndex / GIBindex:
  - Keep evolving shared vocabulary (CoWave, CoSpill, CoScendence, CoHealth, etc.).
  - Prepare for CoGibber and session-offload encodings to be indexable.
- CoAgent / CoArena:
  - Treat CoWave as the default replay unit for productised agents.
  - Use small browser pools, bloat thresholds, and headless CoStatus metrics.
- CoContrib / Onramps:
  - Train new CoStewards in BPOE, CoWave, CoSpill, advisory handoffs, and session hygiene.

## Guardrails Extracted

- Repo is source of truth; sessions are *working memory only*.
- Sessions are expected to **bleed** memory; assume loss, plan for offload.
- Cross-session sharing:
  - Use **advisory files** in Downloads + drag/drop into target sessions.
  - Treat this as *tactical CoSpill*, not accident.
- Actions:
  - Prefer small, reversible CoWaves.
  - Disaster recovery may run *before* committee review when risk is high.
- Security / chaos:
  - Beware helpers or scripts that can propagate widely without oversight.
  - Some assets should behave like an immune system: detect, warn, sometimes quarantine.

## Critical Warnings / Risks

- Silent session-memory compression and loss:
  - Anything not on repo is at risk.
  - Older parts of long sessions are least reliable.
- Attachment drift:
  - Files dragged into one session but never offloaded can become invisible later.
- Complexity creep:
  - More repos + more helpers ⇒ higher blast radius for mistakes.
- Trust erosion:
  - Long thinking-time gaps with no visible CoPong reduce user trust.
  - Browser bloat and stalls can be misread as “AI is failing” unless surfaced via CoHealth.

## Required Repo Targets (Initial Guess)

These are the main repos that should eventually ingest this offload:

- CoSteward:
  - Session-offload, BPOE, CoWave, CoHealth, CoSpill, advisory patterns.
- CoIndex:
  - GIBindex entries for CoWave, CoSpill, CoHealth, CoSessionality, CoScendence.
- CoBus / CoCore / CoAudit / CoProtect (or equivalents):
  - Immune-system assets, disaster-recovery scripts, CoStatus/CoHealth dashboards.
- CoAgent / CoArena:
  - Headless CoWave replay, browser-pool constraints, thinking-time metrics.
- CoContrib:
  - Onramps, training, examples of good CoWave/CoSpill/advisory practice.

## Open Questions For Future Waves

- How to standardise CoSession offload schemas (CoGibber formats) across vendors.
- How to automate detection of “stale session risk” and prompt offload before loss.
- How to measure long-term trust and productivity impacts of CoWave and CoHealth tooling.
