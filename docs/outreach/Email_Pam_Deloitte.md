# Email: Pam — Deloitte Proposal Draft for Comment
_Date: Saturday, November 15, 2025_

Subject: Draft Deloitte proposal for review

Hi Pam,

Per our discussion, I’ve assembled a concise Deloitte‑oriented proposal that frames the value for a first engagement and a follow‑on expansion path. I’d love your edits/comments before we send it via your channel. I’ve also included a light website refresh note so our public pages match the pitch.

**Included**
- Draft Deloitte proposal (Markdown) — focused, 3–4 pages equivalent
- Costing ranges and resourcing assumptions (in‑body section)
- Optional website refresh checklist (tiny)

If this looks about right, I’ll convert to PDF and prepare an Executive forward. Thanks in advance for the redlines.

Best,  
Rick
