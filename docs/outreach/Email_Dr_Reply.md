Subject: Pilot trial assets and next steps

Hi Dr. <Surname>,

Thank you for your note. Below is a concise response and the attachments you requested. Everything is intended to make the pilot simple to run and risk‑light for your team.

**Included attachments**
a) Cost estimate (ranges + knobs)  -  `attachments/Cost_Estimate_trial_v1.csv`  
b) Time estimate and milestones  -  `attachments/Timeline_Estimate_v1.md`  
c) Facilitator Read‑Sheet (single page)  -  `attachments/Trial_Facilitator_ReadSheet_v1.md`  
d) AI Listener Prompt (for voice‑capture setup)  -  `attachments/AI_Listener_Prompt_v1.txt`  
e) (Optional) Participant consent/notice one‑pager  -  `attachments/Class_Consent_OnePager_v1.md`

**Answers to your questions (draft)**
1) Setup effort for your team is minimal (<1 hour). We provide prebuilt prompts and quick‑start steps.  
2) Data handling: local capture with export to CSV/JSON; no PHI is required for the pilot.  
3) IRB sensitivity: we’ve kept this framed as a pedagogical instrumentation pilot; the one‑pager can be adapted to your institution’s standards.  
4) What you get: a heat‑mapped discussion trace, salient quotes, and a short “learning signals” summary after each class.  
5) What we need from you: course context + 2–3 example questions to tune capture phrasing.

**Proposed timeline (sketch)**
- Week 0: confirm consent/notice text + pilot class dates.  
- Week 1: dry run with a 10‑minute mock discussion.  
- Week 2: first live class capture; 24h turnaround for the summary.  
- Week 3: second live class; comparative report.

If you’d like, we can also provide a quick 15‑minute demo over Zoom.

Best regards,  
Rick
