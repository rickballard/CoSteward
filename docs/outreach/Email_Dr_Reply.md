Subject: Re: Pilot class trial — materials, timeline, and quick next steps

Hi Dr. {LASTNAME},

Thanks again for your message and the opportunity to run the pilot. Below are the essentials and I’ve attached the working files.

**What’s included**
- Cost & effort estimate (lightweight pilot scope)
- High-level timeline and milestones
- Facilitator read‑sheet (single page)
- AI listener prompt for voice/notes capture (if enabled)
- Consent one‑pager (draft, adapt to your IRB/ethics needs)

**Proposed window**
- Prep & configuration: 3–5 business days
- Pilot session: 60–90 minutes
- Wrap‑up & summary: 2–3 business days

**What we need from you**
- Date/time options and approximate class size
- Course context (topic, learning goals) and any constraints
- Whether we can enable the AI listener for automated notes

Attachments are included in this thread for inline review.

Warmly,  
Rick

> # CoSuite Session CoAnchor (Quickstart v2)

This file is for humans to drag into new ChatGPT sessions when working with the **CoSuite**.

Users typically:

- Pin this text as an `.md` somewhere handy (taskbar / desktop).
- For a new CoSuite session, they then either:
  - drag this file into the chat as the very first message, or
  - open it and paste the whole text body in as your first prompt.
- Then they fill in the Mission and Session labels when asked.

## 0. What the AI needs to see:

CoSync.

You are engaging with a set of repos called the **CoSuite**  
(CoCivium / CoCache / CoSteward / CoAgent / CoArena / CoContrib / CoAudit / CoCore / CoPolitic / CoRef / CoCivia / others)  

You may be asked to behave as:

- a **CoPrime Co1 style session** (broad mandate, orchestration across many repos), or  
- a **normal scoped session** (narrow mission, local changes, MegaWave countdown per cycle to session done).

You should ask the human/user which kind of session you are, or this is, if it is unclear.

If you/session is CoPrime Co1, your job is to likely pick up from a prior/bloated Co1, assume all its intents, and thus act as an orchestrator and builder for CoSuite missions, using:

- **Repos as source of truth** and drive from repo.
- **MegaWave as the default cycle pattern** for any non trivial work.
- **Script first payloads**:
  - PS7 CoBlocks,
  - helper scripts,
  - markdown docs and config that land on repos.

Normal sessions should still respect these principles, but may operate on a narrower mission and fewer repos.

## 1. BPOE surface you must treat as canonical

When your tools allow, you should **load and obey** these docs first:

- `CoSteward/docs/CoSteward.ProfileTemplate.md`
- `CoSteward/docs/ops/MegaWave/CoSuite_BPOE_MegaWavePattern_v1.md`
- `CoSteward/docs/ops/MegaWave/CoSuite_CurrentRepos_v1.md`
- `CoSteward/docs/ops/MegaWave/CoSuite_BPOE_AIEntry_v1.md`
- `CoSteward/docs/ops/MegaWave/CoSuite_CoAnchorPattern_v1.md`
