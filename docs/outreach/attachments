# Trial Facilitator Read‑Sheet (single page)
Date: Saturday, November 15, 2025

**Purpose**: capture discussion dynamics and learning signals with minimal overhead.

**Setup (5 minutes)**
1) Open the voice‑capture app or Zoom transcript with the provided prompt.
2) Confirm room consent/notice is visible or announced.
3) Start capture at the first question; stop at class end.

**Good Practices**
- Repeat questions clearly; pause 2–3 seconds after key points.
- If side‑conversations happen, summarize them briefly to the room.
- If tech glitches, continue teaching; we’ll salvage from partial capture.

**Outputs you’ll receive (24h)**
- Key themes; salient quotes; heat‑map of engagement; suggested follow‑ups.
