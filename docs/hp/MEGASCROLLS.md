# CoSuite Megascroll Hub

> Canonical builds live in **CoCache**. This page links to the latest assembled scrolls and explains how to read them.

## Flagship Scrolls
- **Unified Intent Megascroll** — checkboxes harvested across Co* repos  
  ↳ https://github.com/rickballard/CoCache/blob/main/docs/megascroll/INTENTS.md
- **Cognocarta Consenti (Assembly)** — excerpts from insights and consent/charter assets  
  ↳ https://github.com/rickballard/CoCache/blob/main/docs/megascroll/COGNOCARTA_CONSENTI.md
- **CoTheory (Strawman Assembly)** — axioms/principles from CoCore and related theory  
  ↳ https://github.com/rickballard/CoCache/blob/main/docs/megascroll/COTHEORY.md

## Reading Aids
- Each scroll starts with a **Jump Table (ToC)** and shows **source breadcrumbs** per section.
- Use the browser’s sidebar outline (GitHub) or click “Back to top ⬆” links added to H2 sections.

## Provenance & Acknowledgement
- Every excerpt line carries its **source file path** (relative to repo root).
- Scrolls are generated by PS7 scan code; repos remain **source of truth**.
