# CoTick BPOE v1

This doc gives seed stage guidance on how sessions and agents should
treat CoTicks and CoTickGuard.

CoTicks are small reinforcement markers on assets that feel aligned
with CoCrux, BPOE, CoGuardRails and CoEvoCascade.

## 1. Principles

- CoTicks are stewardship signals, not vanity metrics.
- They strengthen assets that proved themselves in use.
- They help protect good rails from casual de evolution.
- They must stay cheap but not automatic.

CoTickGuard and CoEvoCascade work together:

- CoEvoCascade captures and composes helpers.
- CoTickGuard reinforces the best versions and patterns.

## 2. When to apply a CoTick

Seed stage rule of thumb:

- After a CoGo wave that feels clearly CoCrux aligned, ask:

  - Did we just produce or refresh a helper, doc or pattern that
    should be treated as a reference for this domain?

If yes:

- Add a CoTick entry to that asset:

  - Short note on why it earned the tick.
  - UTS timestamp.
  - Optional identity of the steward or agent.

Examples of good CoTick moments:

- A BPOE doc that finally stabilises a noisy area.
- A CoGuardRails or CoVaultHydration pattern that feels right after
  stress testing.
- An insights couplet that CoInSeed and InSeed.com flows will reuse.

## 3. When not to apply a CoTick

Avoid CoTicks when:

- The work is speculative and not yet tried in practice.
- The asset is still changing wildly every session.
- The motivation is "this took a lot of effort" rather than
  "this actually works and aligns with CoCrux."

If in doubt, wait.

## 4. Hooks for CoIndex and CoCTA

Over time:

- CoIndex and GIBindex SHOULD be able to see:

  - Which assets have CoTicks.
  - Rough domains of those assets BPOE, guardrails, outreach, etc.

- CoCTA and other agents SHOULD:

  - Prefer CoTick rich assets when looking for examples or rails.
  - Still allow exploration and forking when needed.

CoTicks are one input into "canonical gravity", not the only one.

## 5. Integration with CoInSeed

For CoInSeed and InSeed.com oriented work:

- Teaching packs SHOULD:

  - Mark which examples have CoTicks.
  - Make explicit that CoTicks indicate "this pattern has been used
    and respected, not just written once."

- Flows that propose new rails or frameworks SHOULD:

  - Check for nearby assets with CoTicks before inventing new ones.

This keeps CoCrux, CoGuardRails and CoInSeed aligned instead of
drifting into parallel but incompatible stacks.

## 6. Session behaviour summary

Seed stage sessions SHOULD:

- Treat CoTicks as a normal part of closing a strong wave.
- Record CoTicks where they live best per repo:

  - In file metadata blocks.
  - In a shared index.
  - Or in a future CoTick index service.

- Use CoRetro to see which assets already have CoTicks before
  writing yet another variant.

This BPOE will evolve as CoIndex, CoCTA and other tools catch up,
but even a simple manual CoTick discipline is better than none.
