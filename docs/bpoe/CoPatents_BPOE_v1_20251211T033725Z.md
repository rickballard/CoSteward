# CoPatents BPOE v1

UTS: 20251211T033725Z

This BPOE defines how seed stage CoCivium treats patentable material,
CoTerms and related investor facing surfaces.

It is designed to keep:

- Crown jewels and GLUKEY mechanics safe.
- Public repos clean, academic and civic tech oriented.
- Patent counsel (for example Dentons) properly briefed.
- Darren and other advisors able to help without over exposure.

---

## 1. Disclosure tiers

We use three main tiers:

1. Public surface (GitHub and open decks)
2. Trusted advisors under NDA (for example Darren, selected investors)
3. Patent counsel and LAN vault (for example Dentons, CoCiviumAdmin, HP57)

### 1.1 Public surface

Allowed:

- High level descriptions of problem spaces.
- Concept names and soft CoTerms that do not reveal mechanics.
- Governance framing, ethics framing, stewardship models.
- References to "crown jewel mechanisms stored off repo".

Not allowed:

- Detailed algorithms.
- Architecture that would enable direct replication.
- Specific deal, token or instrument structures.
- Any GLUKEY level detail.

### 1.2 Trusted advisors under NDA

Allowed in controlled packs:

- Clearer descriptions of how pieces fit together.
- Strategy level views of how patents interlock.
- Examples of use cases and market paths.

Still not allowed:

- Full patent draft texts.
- Implementation level diagrams that could ship without CoCivium.
- Anything that would remove the need to work with CoCivium long term.

### 1.3 Patent counsel and LAN vault

Allowed and expected:

- Full technical descriptions.
- Best effort patent claims and prior art notes.
- Interlocking portfolio logic and dependency maps.
- Highly sensitive CoGibber, CoCrux, GLUKEY content.

Storage:

- LAN vaults such as CoCiviumAdmin and HP57.
- Private encrypted archives if needed.
- Minimal referencing on public repos, only as "vault housed" material.

## 2. CoTerms and teaser sheets

A **CoTerm** in this context is a named concept that may support one or
more patents.

Rules:

- Public repos MAY carry:
  - The CoTerm name.
  - A very short, vague teaser description.
- Public repos MUST NOT carry:
  - Full claim language.
  - Direct enabling detail.

Investors and advisors MAY see:

- A printed or PDF "CoPatent CoTerm teaser sheet" that:
  - Lists CoTerm names.
  - Gives one line curiosity sparking descriptions.
  - Labels which items are "vault backed" and "patent counsel advised".

Patent counsel sees:

- Full, precise CoTerm definitions in LAN vault docs.
- Draft claims and diagrams.

---

## 3. Thursday pack and Darren

For the Thursday Darren meeting:

- The "kitchen table pack" SHOULD:
  - Include a teaser sheet of CoTerms.
  - Make it clear which items are:
    - For Darren eyes only.
    - For future investor candidates under NDA.
    - For patent counsel only.

- The CoPre and CoSteward repos MAY:
  - Carry a general "Thursday pack spine" doc.
  - Refer to:
    - "CoPatent CoTerm teaser sheet" (printed or PDF).
    - "Vault housed patent portfolio maps".

They MUST NOT:

- Include the actual sharp diagrams.
- Show detailed flow charts of GLUKEY mechanics.

---

## 4. Counsel briefing (for example Dentons)

When briefing patent counsel:

- Use LAN vault docs as the primary source.
- Provide:
  - Prior art notes where known.
  - Intended business and civic use.
  - Portfolio level goals (interlocking, mutual protection, backups).

On public repos:

- Refer to this only as:
  - "Patent counsel briefed on CoCivium patent portfolio".
  - "Vault housed patent briefs".

---

## 5. Enforcement and CoCrux

This CoPatents BPOE:

- Sits under CoCrux and CoGuardRails.
- Aligns with:
  - CoAxiom2 (trails over tales).
  - CoAxiom5 (anti capture default).
  - CoAxiom7 (hydrated history promise).

Sessions that discover over exposure MUST:

1. Note it in a CoBus entry.
2. Move sharp detail into LAN vaults.
3. Sanitize or rewrite public trails.
4. Optionally log a CoRetro summary in CoSteward or CoCache.

End of BPOE v1.
