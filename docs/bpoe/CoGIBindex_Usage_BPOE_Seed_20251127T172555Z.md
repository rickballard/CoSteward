# CoGIBindex usage – BPOE seed note (v1, additive)

> Draft; additive to existing BPOE docs.  
> Intended to be harvested into CoStyle / CoPermanence / CoOps by Co1.

## 1. Why GIBindex terms should show up in everyday sessions

GIBindex is not just a glossary; it is the **concept backbone** for CoCivium™.

To make it real:

- CoCivites should see **Co\* terms** (CoPortal, CoBrowser, CoEdgeControl, CoEvo, CoRoots,
  CoTree, CoScendence, CoWave, CoAudit™, etc.) flowing naturally through:
  - repo docs,
  - session transcripts,
  - whitepapers and CoPortals,
  - AI conversations.

BPOE implication:

- When a term *exists* in GIBindex, we should:
  - **prefer** that term (and meaning) over ad-hoc synonyms,
  - **link back** to the GIBindex entry when helpful (e.g. \[CoPortal](GIBindex:CoPortal)\),
  - treat GIBindex as the **source of truth** for “what it means right now”.

## 2. Example GIBindex-linked terms (non-exhaustive)

Some high-leverage terms that deserve visible, repeated use:

- **CoPortal** – AI-facing site / asset surface where CoCivites publish for AIs first.  
- **CoBrowser** – edge-controlled action browser that reads CoPortals and launches CoWaves.  
- **CoActionBrowser** – CoBrowser mode focused on running workflows (PRs, AdviceBombs, etc).  
- **CoEdgeControl** – patterns / rails for keeping control at the edge, not on the platform.  
- **CoEvo / CoEvolution** – auto-evolution loops (code, doctrine, social contracts, roles).  
- **CoRoots / CoTree** – dual diagrams for qualifications and concept mastery.  
- **CoScendence** – personal / organisational “levelling up” moment via AI partnership.  
- **CoSteward™** – steward role and practices, especially for hybrid society governance.  
- **CoAudit™** – trust-sourcing / guardrail auditing patterns, not just a single repo.  
- **CoWave / MegaWave** – packaged change wave, with zips, PRs, receipts, CoSync notes.

BPOE suggestion:

- When designing new workflows, prefer to **name them in Co\*** if they fit a
  GIBindex pattern, rather than inventing fresh terms.

## 3. In-session usage pattern (for AIs)

For any AI assisting a CoCivite:

1. When you see a Co\* term:
   - assume there *may* be a GIBindex entry;
   - treat your local understanding as approximate; be ready to adapt as GIBindex evolves.

2. When introducing a new concept that feels like it deserves a Co\* name:
   - propose a candidate Co\* name;
   - clearly state it is **provisional** until GIBindex registers it.

3. When drafting text for repos / CoPortals:
   - use explicit references like:
     - \(see GIBindex:CoPortal)\,
     - \(GIBindex:CoScendence)\,
     - or link-like placeholders \[CoBrowser](GIBindex:CoBrowser)\
   - so that future GIBindex-aware tooling can auto-link and auto-index.

## 4. Next steps

- This note is meant as **feedstock**:
  - Co1 / CoAnchor™ can:
    - extract pieces into CoStyle, CoPermanence, and the CoSteward™ Ops Manual,
    - or keep this as a standalone BPOE appendix.

- It should also inform:
  - CoPortal designs (e.g. InSeed.com, CoCivium™.org),
  - CoAgent™ / CoBrowser UI copy,
  - contributor onboarding (CoContrib™ / CoMap).
