# Advisory – “KingMaker” term deprecation (v1)

Short version: in CoCivium™, **“KingMaker” is an anti-pattern name**.
We will phase it out as a positive label and reserve it for describing
the **old game** we are trying to move beyond.

## 1. What “KingMaker” meant in Sanity+Orgs wave

- It was used as a “visionary sanity check” persona for boards and
  leaders.
- It helped surface:
  - Hidden power concentration,
  - Reality-distortion fields,
  - Narrative capture by small elites.

This was useful, but the **name** suggests:
- Single hero / king / savior logic,
- Centralized power and coronations,
- A frame that clashes with edge-owned governance.

## 2. New naming direction (v1 sketch)

Working terminology (to be refined):

- **“Visionary Sanity Lens”** – generic, board-facing label.
- **“CoSanity / CoScend lens”** – when tied into CoScend patterns.
- “KingMaker” – deprecated term kept only to describe legacy mindsets.

All future positive assets should avoid “KingMaker” in titles where
possible. Use it only when explicitly contrasting:

- “KingMaker world” (old game),
- “CoCivium™ world” (edge-owned, many-mind, post-KingMaker).

## 3. Practical next steps

- When touching Sanity+Orgs / KingMaker files:
  - Keep filenames stable until PRs are merged.
  - Inside the content, introduce the new lens naming.
  - Add a short note that “KingMaker” is legacy naming.

- Future CoIndex™ views:
  - Tag “KingMaker” as **ANTI_PATTERN:POWER_CENTRALIZATION**.
  - Cross-link to the new “Visionary Sanity Lens” concept.

This advisory is a **rails note**. Co1 and future waves will decide
the final naming.
