# CoSession Learnings Playbook (CoCrux Seed)

Goal: ensure every meaningful session leaves a durable, repo-anchored trail of
what was learned about how we work, not just what we built.

## 1. During the Session

- Keep a simple bullet list of:
  - new workflow tricks that helped;
  - failure modes or friction points;
  - decisions about how future sessions should behave.

These are session learnings candidates.

## 2. Before Session Close

For each learning candidate:

1. Decide the right home:
   - BPOE rule doc (global behaviour);
   - repo-specific playbook (local behaviour);
   - tool / DO-block script (automation).

2. Write or update one concrete artefact:
   - add or adjust a numbered rule or checklist;
   - keep it short and imperative.

3. Note the path and heading in the CoSync note.

## 3. CoSync Note Pattern

Each significant session should leave a CoSync note that includes:

- Learnings: 3–7 bullets on:
  - what changed in BPOE / CoCrux rules;
  - what new scripts or playbooks were created;
  - open questions for next sessions.

- Paths: references to updated files, for example:
  - CoSteward/docs/BPOE/CoCrux_Workflow_Rules.md
  - CoIndex/docs/thesis/DrB/04_methodology/phd_best_practice_checklist.md

## 4. Lightweight Prioritisation

When adding new learnings, tag them inline as now, soon, or later so that:
- now items can be actioned in the next 1–2 sessions;
- soon items stay visible but optional;
- later items are parked but not forgotten.

## 5. Retro Moments

Periodically (for example at the end of a MegaWave):

- skim CoSession learnings and backlog;
- merge duplicate rules;
- delete rules that never matter;
- promote essential rules into the main BPOE docs.

The aim is to keep the rule set small, sharp, and live, not bloated.
