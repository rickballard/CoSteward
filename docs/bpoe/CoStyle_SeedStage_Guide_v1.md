# CoStyle seed stage guide v1

This guide captures baseline style expectations for early CoSuite assets.

## Language

* Avoid "local" when you mean persistent. Say "remote repo", "cloud", or "service".
* Treat "local" and "in memory" as temporary, even if disks persist.
* Prefer simple punctuation and single hyphen separators in docs and scripts, avoid em-dashes and other artifacts tyical of AI-only authored human-facing assets.

## Artifacts

* Repo first for anything that should be reused, drive from repo, always where feasible.
* Markdown and PS7 scripts are the default gift formats.
* Diagrams can live in scratchpads until they stabilise, then move into diagrams inventories.
* Users typically CoPing to PS7, any copy/paste block they see, no matter how well the block is delineated, so explore alternative render formats that do not render as copy/paste blocks in session dialogue, to better delineate advisories, user CoEvolutionaries and non-paste-ables. 

## CoStatus

* CoStatusCloud metrics describe remote state such as repos and CI.
* CoStatusLocal metrics describe local environment fit such as PS7 settings, browser settings, profile settings, Windows/OS settings, intersessional memory presets (incl. preference re-inforecements/captures) and startup hygiene.

Future waves will evolve and expand this style guide, and any terms related and via GIBindex repo updates, as CoPermanence and CoStatus mature.
