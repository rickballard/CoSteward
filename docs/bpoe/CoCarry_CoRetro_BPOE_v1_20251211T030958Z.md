# CoCarry & CoRetro – Canonical BPOE Spec (v1)

UTS: 20251211T030958Z

This document defines **CoCarry** and **CoRetro** as structural BPOE rails
for seed-stage CoCivium and MUST be followed by all roles (Co1, CoPrime,
CoPre, CoMeta, CoAgent, CoArena, Outreaches, and future roles).

---

## 1. CoCarry (session-to-repo mandatory offload)

CoCarry means:

- Sessions MUST NOT hold heavy conceptual load for more than a wave.
- All durable insights MUST land:
  - In repo (CoSteward, CoIndex, CoMeta, CoCivium, etc)
  - Or in LAN vaults (for sharp mechanics, HP57, GLUKEY material)

CoCarry prevents:
- Memory-loss
- Token overflow
- Context collapse
- Drift
- Silent corruption

CoCarry enforces:
- Trails over tales (CoAxiom2)
- Repo-as-source-of-truth
- Session minimalism
- Deterministic reproducibility

---

## 2. CoRetro (bidirectional reach + creative extension)

CoRetro MUST run every wave.

CoRetro has TWO halves:

### 2.1. Retro-Flow (internal)
Sessions MUST reach inward to:
- All CoSuite repos
- Insight folder couples
- CoIndex
- CoCrux
- BPOE rails
- LAN vault (for sensitive variants)
- Past PRs and trails
- Handoff packs (HP57 mirrors)

Purpose:
- Detect inconsistencies
- Catch drift
- Reconcile ontology
- Align terminology
- Restore canonical rails

### 2.2. Retro-Reach (external)
Sessions MUST reach outward to:
- Training-derived conceptual knowledge
- Public open-source materials
- Academic frameworks
- Governance models
- Best-practice ecosystems

Purpose:
- CoCapture new patterns
- CoContrast ideas
- CoInSeed variants
- CoInfer new evolutionary handles

### 2.3. Creative Reach Clause
CoRetro MUST ALWAYS attempt:
- Re-routing discovery paths
- Unblocking dead-ends
- Reassembling ideas via session-history sweeps
- Re-deriving missing connections
- Using analogies, inversions, contrasts, or cross-domain mappings

This clause exists specifically to:
- Overcome token limits
- Overcome memory limits
- Overcome platform constraints
- Maintain semantic continuity across multi-session arcs

---

## 3. CoRetro Deliverables

Each wave SHOULD produce:
- A CoRetro-Plan (pre-wave alignment)
- A CoRetro-Delta (semantic diff)
- An updated repo artifact or PR
- Optional: CoBus notice if cross-session impact exists

---

## 4. Enforcement

CoCarry + CoRetro together form part of **CoCrux**.

Any session approaching:
- HARD or FATAL CoBloat
- 3–4 day tenure limits
- Semantic drift alerts
- Missing-trail conditions

MUST:

1. Run CoRetro immediately  
2. Execute CoCarry offload  
3. Produce a CoBus handoff notice  
4. End or rotate

---

End of spec.
