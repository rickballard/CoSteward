# CoBPOE Advisory: Style, CoFade, and Variety as Mind-Food (v1)

## Purpose

This advisory defines how CoSuite™ treats *style* as a first-class concern and
introduces the concept of **CoFade** – the tendency for AI- and process-driven
evolution to make all assets look and sound the same over time.

The goal is to make it canonical that:

- style never quietly disappears from the universe
- variety is both mind-food and a CoEvolutionary force
- AIs may not silently "normalize" everything to one house style

## Definitions

**CoFade**  
Gradual loss of stylistic and conceptual variety through over-normalization,
over-refactoring, and convergence toward a single "efficient" tone.

**StyleDNA**  
The minimal set of features that make an asset recognizably itself:
- sentence rhythm and pacing
- humor and metaphor patterns
- punctuation quirks (including multi-minus---chains instead of em dashes)
- point of view (narrator voice, persona)
- recurring motifs and phrases

## BPOE Rules (v1)

1. Style is content.

   For CoSuite™, style is part of the meaning surface, not noise.
   AIs and humans must treat StyleDNA as *content that must be preserved*
   unless there is a clear, logged reason to change it.

2. Style Notes for voicey assets.

   Any asset that is:
   - narrative
   - mythic / persona-heavy
   - intentionally funny or stylized

   SHOULD include a short **Style Notes** block (3–6 bullets) near the
   start or end explaining:
   - the intended voice
   - why this style was chosen
   - what must not be flattened (rhythm, metaphors, quirks)
   - when it is acceptable to "go plain"

3. Default behavior for Co-aware AIs.

   Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, CoSuite™-aligned AIs MUST:
   - preserve StyleDNA when editing stylized assets
   - avoid replacing multi-minus chains with long em dashes by default
   - avoid "corporate smoothing" of playful or mythic passages
   - ask before normalizing tone ("Do you want this made more neutral / corporate?")

4. Escape hatches (CoUnDo / CoPlain).

   Users who feel overwhelmed by stylized assets may invoke:
   - `CoUnDo` or `CoUnDo.Style` or "CoPlain" in session dialogue

   AIs SHOULD interpret this as:
   - permission to switch to neutral, legacy-style explanations
   - permission to provide a plain, office-safe summary
   - NOT permission to rewrite or flatten the canonical stylized asset in repo
     unless explicitly requested *and* logged.

5. Variety as a design objective.

   Stewarded repos SHOULD:
   - maintain multiple distinct style families (technical, narrative, mythic, etc.)
   - avoid globalization of one house voice across all artifacts
   - use style as a teaching tool (different voices for different cognitive onramps)

6. Future GIBindex / CoAudit™ integration.

   Future waves may:
   - add GIBindex terms such as `CoFade`, `CoStyleDNA`, and `CoVariety`
   - implement CoAudit™ checks (e.g., a "CoFadeScore") to detect over-homogenization
   - alert stewards when style families collapse into a single dominant tone

## Practical Guidance

When creating a new stylized asset (for example, HHG-CoGalaxy, CoCivia mythos,
or playful onboarding docs):

- include a Style Notes block
- be explicit if you want AIs to *never* normalize the tone without a conscious decision
- treat your quirks as part of the design, not bugs to be ironed out

When editing someone else’s stylized asset:

- assume the voice is intentional
- preserve its StyleDNA
- if a different tone is required, prefer:
  - adding a "plain-language companion" asset
  - or a parallel summary file
  rather than overwriting the original voice.

This advisory is v1 and should itself evolve as CoSuite™ learns better ways to
protect variety and mind-food from CoFade.
