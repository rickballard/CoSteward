# CoSteward Role: Definition and Responsibilities

## 1. What is a CoSteward

A **CoSteward** is a leader who treats their organisation as a living system in a **hybrid society**; a world where every meaningful action involves humans and AIs interacting in real time.

Legacy leadership models treated the CEO as the single point of force and the single point of blame. A CoSteward replaces that idea with something more honest and more powerful:

> The job is not to control everything. The job is to steward a system that can learn and evolve faster than any one person.

A CoSteward is still accountable; still visible; still carries responsibility. The difference is that they no longer pretend to win a massively parallel AI powered game with a single human brain at the centre. They design conditions so that many brains and many systems can improve together.

## 2. From Chief Executive Officer to Chief Steward Officer

We are not asking leaders to be a little kinder or a little more digital. We are asking them to retire an old job description and adopt a new one.

- **Chief Executive Officer**  
  - Focus: execution and personal performance  
  - Story: "I decide; others execute"  
  - Structure: most power and information flows to the top  
  - Risk: the top becomes the bottleneck and the scapegoat  

- **Chief Steward Officer (CoSteward)**  
  - Focus: system health; adaptive capacity; social impact  
  - Story: "I shape the conditions so the system can learn faster than I can"  
  - Structure: information and power are pushed to the edge with clear guardrails  
  - Risk: pretending to be neutral; reward: shared accountability and durable progress  

A CoSteward still signs the contracts and faces the board. The difference is that they quietly change the physics in which the organisation operates. They rewire processes, incentives and tools so that good behaviour is easier and harmful behaviour is harder, for both humans and AIs.

## 3. Core principles of CoStewardship

A working short list of principles:

1. **Hybrid first**  
   Always assume that staff, customers, regulators and competitors are using AI. Design governance, products and processes with that reality in mind. Never plan as if you are the only one with AI tools.

2. **Edge informed; centre accountable**  
   The edge usually has better information than the centre. A CoSteward makes it safe and normal for information, patterns and concerns to flow inwards, while keeping clear accountability at the top.

3. **Process before heroics**  
   Heroic effort is a sign of bad design. CoStewards redirect praise away from last minute rescues and toward better processes that prevent the need for rescue in the first place.

4. **Transparent trade offs**  
   Every decision moves risk, cost and benefit between groups. CoStewards insist on making these trade offs visible, especially where AI systems affect vulnerable people or long term societal outcomes.

5. **CoScendence as a signal**  
   The whitepaper defines **CoScendence** as the feeling when chaos stops looking like failure and starts looking like the early stage of a new kind of leadership. CoStewards use that feeling as a rough compass; if people never feel it, the system is probably not improving in the right way.

6. **CoOrbit instead of flat SWOT**  
   Strategy lives in a moving field; not a four box grid. CoStewards ask for a **CoOrbit Map** that shows where AI is amplifying value; where it is eroding the business model; and where the organisation is helping or harming society.

7. **Human plus AI; not human versus AI**  
   CoStewards avoid false battles between humans and AIs. The real struggle is between good and bad use of power. They design human plus AI workflows that respect human dignity, improve outcomes and keep power accountable.

## 4. Practical responsibilities

Concrete expectations for a CoSteward in day to day work:

### 4.1 Governance

- Sponsor and protect independent audit and ethics functions that can review AI use and data practices  
- Ensure that board members understand hybrid society basics; not only financials  

### 4.2 Organisation design

- Push decision making closer to where information and relationships live  
- Create safe channels where staff can surface AI risks, automation wins and customer stories  

### 4.3 Tooling and data

- Treat AI and data tooling as shared infrastructure; not private perks for a few teams  
- Require that critical AI workflows are observable; explainable in plain language; and auditable  

### 4.4 Talent and culture

- Reward people for learning, teaching and improving systems; not only for hitting short term numbers  
- Promote people who show steward behaviour; coach or move people who hoard power and hide risk  

### 4.5 External impact

- Map how the organisation affects customers, communities, regulators and the wider ecosystem  
- Use the CoOrbit lens to adjust strategy so that the organisation earns long term trust  

## 5. How someone becomes a CoSteward

There is no single certificate that makes someone a CoSteward. There is only a pattern of behaviour and a willingness to change.

Typical signals that someone is on the path:

- They read the CoSteward whitepaper and recognise their own experience in the pain described  
- They shift from asking "How do I fix my people" to "How do I fix the system they are forced to work in"  
- They start talking about process, structure and incentives; not only effort, discipline and toughness  
- They show curiosity about AI; not only fear or hype  
- They are willing to put their reputation behind experiments that move power and information closer to the edge  

When enough leaders behave this way, **CoStewardship** stops being a personal trait and becomes an institutional habit.

This document should be treated as a living definition. Future waves will refine the role as more organisations practice it and as CoOrbit, CoGo and CoCraftBalance tools mature.
