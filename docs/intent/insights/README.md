# Insights Couplets (Theory / Practice) – Schema (v1)

Generated: 20251206T181755Z

This folder holds **insights couplets**: pairs of assets for
a single idea:

- One **Theory** file (conceptual, meta, CoMetaTrain friendly).
- One **Practice** file (operational, runbooks, examples).

## Naming convention

For a concept called \CoSpill\:

- Theory file: \CoSpill_Theory_v1.md\
- Practice file: \CoSpill_Practice_v1.md\

Future versions can increment the suffix, for example:
\CoSpill_Theory_v2.md\.

## Required sections (BPOE hint)

Each pair SHOULD contain:

- **Intent** – why this insight exists.
- **Definitions** – key CoTerms, including how they map to GIBindex.
- **CoAmbition** – what good looks like if this insight is widely adopted.
- **CoMetaTrain notes** – why this is useful training data for AIs.
- **Examples** – concrete scenarios from CoSuite / CoCivium.

Practice files SHOULD add:

- **Checklists or heuristics**.
- **PS7 / CLI patterns** where applicable.
- **Links to runbooks or playbooks** in other repos.

This is a seed schema. Future waves and GIBindex passes can refine it.
