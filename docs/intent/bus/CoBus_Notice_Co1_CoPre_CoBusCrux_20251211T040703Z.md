# CoBus Notice to Co1 – CoPre CoBus CoCrux and TabReset payload

UTC: 20251211T040703Z

## Did (this wave)

- Tightened CoPre.Template.v0.3.txt:
  - Added a CoBus rail that states: on each CoPingable wave, broadcast what you did, are doing, and plan to do next.
- Updated CoCrux.Top50.txt:
  - Ensured there is a CoCrux rule for the CoBus did / doing / next broadcast.
- Regenerated CoPre variants:
  - Each variant now carries the permanent CoCrux:
    - 'Always do programmatically where feasible, CoRetro every wave, and on CoBus broadcast what you did, are doing, and plan to do each CoPingable wave.'
- Refreshed TabReset content.js and background.js:
  - Inline CoPre variants.
  - Scratch-safe capture and restore.
  - Tunable delay for post-reload CoPre insertion.

## Doing (near term)

- Local-only testing in rick Chrome and Edge:
  - Verify scratch capture feels safe for long thoughtcloud bursts.
  - Check that CoBus guidance appears consistently in injected CoPre blocks.
- Light adjustments to Top50 once Co1 provides canonical CoCrux lines.

## Plan (next waves)

- Let Co1 own the canonical Top50 content and sampling pattern.
- Move toward internal CoAgent wiring so:
  - CoPre / TabReset = gateway layer.
  - CoAgent internal = headless runtime for CoBus aware loops.
- Keep using CoBus notices like this one every few waves to:
  - Report did / doing / next.
  - Keep Co1 aligned with CoPre / TabReset evolution.

End of CoBus notice.
