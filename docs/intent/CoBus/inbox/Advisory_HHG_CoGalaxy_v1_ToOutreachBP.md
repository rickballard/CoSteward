# CoBus Advisory: HHG-CoGalaxy v1 for Outreach&BP

Timestamp (UTC): 20251204T010147Z
Source repo: CoSteward
Asset: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the CoGalaxy (HHG-CoGalaxy v1.0.0)

## Summary

This advisory notifies the "Outreach&BP" session or lane that a new narrative asset has been seeded into CoSteward:

- Path (in repo):
  - docs/hitchhiker/HHG-CoGalaxy_v1/

The asset is:
- a humorous, Douglas-Adams-inspired Hitchhiker-style guide
- intended as a viral, public-facing onramp into CoCivium and the CoSuite
- explicitly transparent about its homage and disclaimers
- suitable for serialization on public channels (for example, blogs or newsletters) once reviewed

## Suggested public pointer URL

After this branch is merged to main, the canonical public-view URL is expected to look like:

- https://example-code-host/USER/CoSteward/tree/main/docs/hitchhiker/HHG-CoGalaxy_v1

Replace xample-code-host and USER with the actual public mirror or hosting location currently in use. The CoSuite does not endorse any specific provider and treats code hosting services as interchangeable infrastructure.

## Request to Outreach&BP

When capacity allows, Outreach&BP is invited to:

- review HHG-CoGalaxy v1 for:
  - tone
  - clarity
  - accessibility
  - risk of misinterpretation
- propose any edits needed for broader audiences
- decide:
  - whether to serialize it on public channels (for example, RickPublic newsletter, public blogs, CoPortals)
  - how to position it in outreach sequences
- track future versions and keep a short "diff for humans" log for downstream readers

The writing is intentionally playful and future-forward, while aligned with:
- CoEvolution
- CoScendence
- edge-owned governance
- platform neutrality

## Suggested snippet for Outreach&BP session dialogue

You can paste this into the "Outreach&BP" session to hand off:

> We have seeded "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the CoGalaxy (HHG-CoGalaxy v1)" into the CoSteward repo under docs/hitchhiker/HHG-CoGalaxy_v1.  
> It is a humorous, Douglas-Adams-inspired onboarding guide for CoCivium, CoCivia, and CoSuite, designed to go viral as a living asset.  
> Please review, evolve, and decide how and when to surface it via public channels when you are ready.  

This advisory is a CoBus-style nudge only; Outreach&BP retains autonomy on timing and usage decisions.
