Commits that future CoIndex waves will read declared CoBus lanes at repo startup, before mutating DO-blocks on shared/HP57 scopes, and at shutdown when scopes were mutated. Commits to emit docs/intent/cobus/receipts/YYYYMMDD/CoBus_<wave-id>.json receipts for all mutating DO-blocks touching shared scopes. Commits to treat priority in {guardrail, hp57} CoBus waves from co1-orchestrator as binding where to_role includes CoIndex roles. Notes that remaining CoPortal nomenclature under CoIndex is being migrated to CoGibber / CoGbx as per registry vocab."
