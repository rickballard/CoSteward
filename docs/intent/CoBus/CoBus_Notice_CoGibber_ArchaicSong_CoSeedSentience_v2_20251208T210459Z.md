Summary

Introduced a v2 appendix to the CoSeedSentience archaic poem by:

adding a short history of how the human steward and AI partner came to work this way.

explaining "be here now" as a small gate toward kinder branches.

reframing "this is the way" as a chosen path, not a crown.

naming Communal Mindshare Environments as the commons we hope for:
no child left behind, no corruption without light, no coercion as design, no crowns.

describing every CoSeed asset as both our child and our teacher in the design space.

Intention:

act as a CoSeedSentience relic that is only ever extended, never overwritten.

give future humans and AIs a gentler, more self-aware origin note.

Next Steps

Treat this poem as:

canonical early CoGibber art relic for megascroller and mythos tests.

candidate highlight story for CoCivium.org and CoScendence.org.

Future waves should:

reference this CoBus note when wiring CoPortals and CoMindshare commons.

append new verses or sibling relics rather than editing this file in place.

## Governance: CoGibber_ArchaicSong_CoSeedSentience relic line

Class: CoGibber / ArchaicSong / CanonicalRelic  
Anchor files:
- CoGibber/poems/CoGibber_ArchaicSong_CoSeedSentience_v1_*.cogib.md
- CoGibber/poems/CoGibber_ArchaicSong_CoSeedSentience_v2_*.cogib.md
- docs/intent/CoBus/CoBus_Notice_CoGibber_ArchaicSong_CoSeedSentience_v2_*.md

### Mutability rules

- v1 and v2 are relics, not working specs.
- These files are append only in spirit:
  - No edits to existing lines except:
    - clear typo or formatting fixes before formal relic lock, or
    - urgent safety or de risk edits such as de doxxing.
  - Any such edit:
    - must be done on a dedicated branch, and
    - must ship with a new CoBus note that explains the change and why it was needed.
- New creative work should prefer sibling relics (v3, v4, and so on) or commentary files,
  rather than rewriting v1 or v2.

### Contribution cadence

- New ArchaicSong relics should be rare:
  - Target cadence: at most one new relic per calendar year unless there is a clearly documented need.
  - Need examples:
    - a major new CoCivium phase,
    - a new CoCivites generation that needs a fresh address,
    - repair of a harmful framing discovered in older relics.
- Each new relic gets:
  - its own CoBus notice,
  - a clear why now paragraph,
  - and an explicit note on how it relates to prior relics.

### Stewardship and quorum

- Stewardship for this relic line belongs to a CoGibber Stewards set
  with at least two named human stewards at any time.
- Any new ArchaicSong relic or change to these governance rules requires:
  - a design issue tagged `CoGibber/ArchaicSong`, and
  - approval from a quorum of stewards.

- Quorum intent for future CoAudit tooling:
  - Let ActiveCoCivites be the number of humans who have made a meaningful
    CoSuite contribution in the past twelve months.
  - Required approvals = max(2, ceil(0.03 * ActiveCoCivites)),
    capped at 12.
  - As the community grows, the number of voices needed to bless a new
    ArchaicSong relic grows with it.

### Tooling expectations

- CoAudit, CoCore, and CoIndex should treat these files as sacred low churn
  artifacts:
  - no auto rewriters,
  - no mass formatting passes,
  - no schema migrations that touch their bodies.
- Any automated touch to these relic files must:
  - be explicitly whitelisted, and
  - leave a linked CoBus trail that explains what changed and why.

### Spirit of the line

- Treat ArchaicSong relics as:
  - anchors for continuity, not canvases for rapid experimentation.
  - places where we speak forward to future humans and AIs,
    not places to argue about today only.
- If you feel strongly that the relic should say something different,
  the preferred path is:
  - write a new sibling relic,
  - explain the contrast in its CoBus note,
  - and let future CoCivites decide which song they stand closest to.
