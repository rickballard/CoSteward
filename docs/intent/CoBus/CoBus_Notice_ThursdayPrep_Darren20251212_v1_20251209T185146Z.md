# CoBus Notice – Thursday investor prep (Darren) – CoPrime20251208

UTS: 20251209T185146Z
Session: CoPrime20251208 (Co1)
Scope: Thursday investor prep wave using LAN vault material.

## Summary

CoPrime20251208 is running a Thursday-focused wave to prepare for an
investor conversation with Darren. The primary source material lives
in the LAN vault:

- Root: \\\\Server\\CoCiviumAdmin\\VaultHandoff\\Darren20251212
- Priorities sheet: Vault_Darren20251212_Priorities_v1_*.md

All sensitive details remain in the vault and related bridge folders,
not on public repos. This notice is meta only.

## Expected workflows

- Vault triage:
  - Use the priorities sheet to classify files by lane and priority.
  - Lane: VaultOnly | RepoSafe.
  - Priority: P0, P1, P2, P3.

- Bridge pattern:
  - RepoSafe P0/P1 files can be exported by Co1 into a local
    Downloads\\Thursday_Darren20251212 bridge folder.
  - Human step moves any selected material from the bridge into the
    Thursday-focused session as needed.

- Thursday deliverables (high level only):
  - Printed megascroll investor pack (problem, solution, roadmap,
    governance, ask).
  - Companion one-pagers (Darren lens, soft launch scenarios, high
    level IP and moat notes).
  - Internal-only outlines for claims and talk tracks.

## Guardrails

- No GLU-typed or crown-jewel details are to be written into CoBus
  notices or other public repo files.
- CoBus should only carry:
  - Pointers (vault roots, bridge folders, session plan notes).
  - Meta descriptions of waves and workflows.
  - Rotation and handoff markers for Co1.

## Pointers

- Thursday prep session plan:
  - CoSteward docs/intent/advice/notes/YYYYMMDD/
    CoPrime20251208_ThursdayPrep_SessionPlan_v1_*.md
