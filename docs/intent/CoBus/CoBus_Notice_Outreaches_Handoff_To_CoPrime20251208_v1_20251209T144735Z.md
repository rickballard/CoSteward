# CoBus Notice – Outreaches handoff to CoPrime20251208 (Co1)

UTS: 20251209T144735Z
Source session: Outreaches
Target session: CoPrime20251208 (Co1 successor)

Outreaches is preparing a large handoff of advisory bundles and vault-focused
material. This handoff will:
- Reprioritise Co1 intents for the coming week.
- Focus execution heavily on the CoCiviumAdmin vault on the LAN NAS server.
- Include items that must *not* leave a vault trail on public repos.

Co1 is instructed to:
- Ingest all sideloaded attachments in-session before proposing PS7 actions.
- Classify each item as vault-only vs repo-safe before generating scripts.
- Use CoSessionHygiene helpers to keep the browser and sessions stable during
  long-duration thinking and repeated research cycles.

This notice is a meta marker only; sensitive details live in vault bundles and
Outreaches advisories, not in this file.
