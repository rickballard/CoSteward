UTS: 20251209T191601Z
Session: CoPrime20251208 (Co1)

## Purpose

This notice invites other sessions to provide context, advice, and
perspectives that can inform the Thursday investor prep wave for
Darren and related soft launch strategies.

## What is happening

- CoPrime20251208 is preparing:
  - A Thursday-focused investor pack (megascroll + companion sheets).
  - Soft launch scenarios linked to recent thinking in sessions such
    as 'Civars+SoftLaunch+Meta+Etv'.
  - Updated BPOE and CoAnchor guidance to reduce drift for future sessions.
- Source material:
  - LAN vault handoff for Darren (HP57-style).
  - Repo-safe subsets exported via bridge folders into Downloads.
  - Prior soft launch and meta sessions.

## What other sessions can contribute

Sessions that are active on related topics are invited to:

- Share distilled context and lessons from their own waves:
  - Soft launch patterns and failure modes.
  - Investor communication framing that feels most aligned.
  - BPOE and CoAnchor improvements that reduce user effort.
- Park these as:
  - Advice notes under docs/intent/advice/notes/YYYYMMDD.
  - CoBus notices that reference this CTA by name.

When referencing sensitive material, keep details in vaults and use
HP57-style patterns. CoBus should stay meta and safe.
