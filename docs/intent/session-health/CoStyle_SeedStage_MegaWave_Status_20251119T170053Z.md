# CoStyle seed-stage MegaWave – status

Date: 20251119T170053Z

## What ran

- MW_StyleSweep_EmDash_AllRepos_v2 – mechanical — →  -  across all local CoSuite repos.
- MW_StyleSweep_EmDash_Followup_v1 – CSV of lines with word - word joints.
- MW_StyleSweep_CodeFence_Parity_v1 – CSV of files with odd code fences or suspicious \\\mermaid blocks.
- MW_StyleSweep_AIStyleLint_v2 – CSV of lines with classic AI boilerplate.
- CoStyle_SeedStage_Guide_v1.md – seed-stage BPOE style guide for human-facing assets.

## How to use this later

- Treat the CSVs in .local/style-scan as backlogs for human passes, not mandatory immediate fixes.
- Prioritise public-facing repos (CoCivium-website, CoCivium-outreach, RickPublic) when doing readability sweeps.
- Wire these sweeps into CoAudit / CoIgniter once those waves mature.

## Status

- Style MegaWave: **seeded and parked**.
- Main rails (CoPrime/Co1, CoModules20251118, CoArena20251118, CoCivia20251118): ready to resume.
