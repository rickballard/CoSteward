# CoPrime20251118 – Session Health Pulse v0.1

> Generated from CoIgniter_SessionHealth_Scan.ps1 (MegaWave4b) and CoPulse spec v0.1.

## CoIgniter category counts

| Category            | Count |
|---------------------|-------|
| session-sweep       |     6 |
| login-friction      |     2 |
| handover            |     2 |
| queue-orchestration |     1 |
| session-report      |     1 |

Interpretation:

- **session-sweep (6)** → heavy focus on mobile sweeps, wraps, and attempts to clean up / rotate.
- **login-friction (2)** → repeated login/persistence pain is a real pattern, not a one-off.
- **handover (2)** → multiple explicit attempts to hand off to a new orchestrator (CoPrime).
- **queue-orchestration (1)** → at least one explicit action-tickets / queue design doc.
- **session-report (1)** → there is at least one session wrap / migration report doc.

## CoBloat heartbeat (CoPrime20251118)

- CU (Context Usage): SOFT – CoPrime anchored in AdviceBomb_CoPrime20251118 + CoSteward/CoCivium docs.
- PU (Payload Usage): SOFT – One large AdviceBomb, but zipped, logged, and triaged.
- HU (Human Usage):  HARD – Many new patterns, waves, and terms; cognitive load is high.
- WT (Wait/Time):    SOFT→HARD – Login + reload friction present but now captured as advisories.

Rotate posture:

- CoRotate: **IN-PROGRESS** (this CoPrime orchestrator is the fresh session).
- CoRescue: **COMPLETE** for the previous CoWinnian/CoCivium session (wisdom routed via AdviceBomb).

## CoPulse metrics (B1–B4) snapshot

| Metric | Meaning                                  | Score | Notes
|--------|------------------------------------------|-------|------
| B1     | AdviceBomb coverage                      | 2     | AdviceBomb_CoPrime20251118.zip + .sha256 + INBOX_LOG.md |
| B2     | Session-health triage presence           | 2     | CoPrime_SessionHealth_Triage_v1.md exists                |
| B3     | Pattern docs (CoBloat/CoRotate/CoRescue) | 2     | v1 guides seeded in docs/intent/session-health/          |
| B4     | CoDitto density (qualitative)            | 1     | Repeated human patterns noted, but early-stage tooling   |

## Next steps (suggested)

- Promote key Co1_* advisories into named patterns (login persistence, mobile sweep, handover).
- Add simple CoPulse runners for other missions (CoArena20251118, CoModules20251118, etc.).
- Tighten CoRotate triggers so that heavy-session symptoms auto-suggest rotation earlier.
- Grow CoDitto handling: recognise repeated human asks and auto-surface related pattern docs.
