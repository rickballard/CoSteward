# CoSteward Operations Manual – Upgrade Plan (v1)

Seeded: 20251207T171233Z
AnchorsUsed: [CoSteward, CoHeart, CoPulse, CoGate, CoMetaTrain, CoCTA, CoGibber]

## 1. Goal

This document specifies how the existing CoSteward Operations Manual should be
extended in future waves. It does not attempt to overwrite the manual directly.

## 2. New Content Areas To Add

- CoHeart:
  - role as coherence and polishing organ,
  - relationship to CoCacheGlobal and CoMetaTrain lineage.

- CoPulse:
  - high level description of sonic and visual expressions of system health,
  - how CoStewards should interpret CoPulse signals.

- CoGate:
  - civilizational Prime Directive framing,
  - worthiness as care greater than self,
  - architectural implications (design for slowest and most fragile beings).

- Tier A/B/C lineage protocols:
  - Tier A: live guardrails (e.g. CoMetaTrain lineage stub),
  - Tier B: deliberate archaeology runs,
  - Tier C: rare CoSuite sweeps.

- CoMetaTrain schema:
  - CoScope, CoIntent, CoFit, CoAmbition, CoBlastRadius, CoTransparencies,
    CoReferences, CoLimitations, CoSeeds,
  - expectations that key manuals and top level assets carry these fields.

- Evolving footers:
  - CoLife (last revitalisation event),
  - CoPotential (next evolutions desired),
  - CoMetaTrain version reference,
  - pointer into GIBindex where relevant.

- CoCTA framing:
  - CoCTAs as gentle, piloted mechanisms,
  - explicit prohibition against "locust" style escalating nags,
  - clear coupling to Tier A/B/C and CoCTA ethics.

- CoGibber:
  - definition as internal high density language layer,
  - separation between human facing docs and CoGibber internal overlays,
  - notes on future integration with CoPulse and CoMetaTrain.

## 3. Responsibilities

- CoStewards:
  - keep the manual aligned with CoHeart and CoCTA ethics,
  - ensure new session classes and roles are documented.

- Co1:
  - approve major changes that affect cross repo behavior.

- Co3:
  - track how stewardship concepts have evolved.

## 4. Next Steps

Future waves should:

- diff the current manual against this plan,
- implement additions in small, reviewable sections,
- keep changes under version control with clear lineage notes.

This plan should be treated as an intent declaration, not as the manual itself.
