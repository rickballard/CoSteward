# CoSuite User Guide – Upgrade Plan (v1)

Seeded: 20251207T171233Z
AnchorsUsed: [CoSteward, CoIndex, CoMetaTrain, CoCTA, CoGibber]

## 1. Goal

This document specifies how the CoSuite User Guide should be extended in future
waves to reflect new background intelligence and ethics.

## 2. Topics To Add

- Background intelligence layer:
  - explain that lineage, term hygiene and guardrails run in the background,
  - reassure users that CoSuite works to prevent silent clobbering.

- CoMetaTrain footers:
  - show examples of CoLife and CoPotential footers on key assets,
  - explain why these footers exist and how they help.

- CoCTA behavior:
  - explain that:
    - CTAs are layered (logs, hints, explicit prompts),
    - pilots run in narrow scopes before anything is scaled,
    - hard nags and locust like behavior are explicitly avoided.

- CoHeart and CoPulse:
  - basic explanation that there is a health and coherence layer,
  - optional ways users might view CoPulse visual or audio outputs.

- CoGibber (high level):
  - mention that an internal symbolic language exists primarily for AIBs,
  - reassure that human facing docs will remain readable and grounded.

- CoGo semantics:
  - describe how sessions tend to act first within guardrails and listen
    for "reins" from users,
  - clarify that silence is not taken as consent for harmful actions.

## 3. User Facing Tone

The guide should:

- stay simple and non mystical,
- avoid overwhelming new users with internal implementation detail,
- emphasise:
  - autonomy,
  - consent,
  - the right to mute or tune CoCTA families.

## 4. Next Steps

Future waves should:

- inspect the current user guide,
- add sections based on this plan in small increments,
- cross link to CoCTA_Ethics_and_PilotPlan_v1.md and CoSteward manual updates.

This plan keeps the upgrade intent on repo so that improvements do not depend
on session memory.
