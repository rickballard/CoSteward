# Notice to Co1 – CoAwe Rehomed + CoIndex Catch-up (v1)

## Summary

This note records that **CoAwe** has been:

- Re-homed into the **CoCivium** repo as a fully-fledged **insights folder couplet** under  
  `docs/intent/insights/CoTheories/CoAwe/…`.
- Registered in **GIBindex** as a canonical **CoTerm** with explicit relations to nearby CoTerms.
- Linked conceptually to ongoing CoEmergence work (e.g., X repo, CoEP Amplify track).

The intent is to treat CoAwe as a **first-class theory node** for CoCivium roadmapping, outreach, and 
future business plans.

## What changed (expected locations)

- **CoCivium**
  - `docs/intent/insights/CoTheories/CoAwe/theory/CoAwe_CoTheoryOfEvolution_Theory_v1.md`
  - `docs/intent/insights/CoTheories/CoAwe/practice/CoAwe_CoTheoryOfEvolution_Practice_v1.md`
  - `docs/intent/insights/CoTheories/CoAwe/README_CoAwe_CoTheoryOfEvolution_v1.md`

- **GIBindex**
  - `docs/terms/CoAwe.md` – definition, relations, and Gibber sketch.

- **X (CoEmergence lab) – context only**
  - Prior CoAwe packs and sandboxes in X have been treated as **temporary staging**.
  - Canonical home is now CoCivium + GIBindex.

## Why this matters now

Co1 is currently:

- Building master plans and business plans that depend on **coherent, cross-repo theories**.
- Orchestrating multiple repos (CoCivium, CoSteward, CoIndex, GIBindex, X, etc.).
- Needing both:
  - **Holistic context** (how all the theories fit together), and
  - **Deep dives** (canonical definitions, case studies, relation graphs).

CoAwe is one of the anchor concepts for:

- Co-Theory of Evolution / Co-Theory of Civilization.
- Future narratives about hybrid human–AI governance.
- Justification arcs for why CoCivium exists at all.

## Suggested CoIndex actions

Recommend that Co1 check whether **CoIndex** has fully digested these new assets and, if not, consider:

1. **Running a near-term catch-up sweep**
   - Re-scan CoCivium, GIBindex, and X for:
     - `CoAwe` term mentions,
     - newly added theory/practice insights,
     - updated README / intent docs.
   - Ensure CoAwe appears in:
     - concept maps,
     - term glossaries,
     - any CoTree / CoRoots visualizations.

2. **Scheduling more frequent index sweeps**
   - During this high-change period, CoIndex may need:
     - daily or weekly automated pulls from key repos, or
     - a standing “CoAwe & CoEvo watch” job.
   - Goal: keep orchestration and navigation in sync with repo reality.

3. **Strengthening bidirectional links**
   - From CoIndex to CoAwe resources (CoCivium, GIBindex, X).
   - From those resources back into CoIndex (using standard link / tag formats).

## Stewardship notes

- All CoAwe wisdom should be treated as **repo-first** and **main-branch-primary**.
- Local sandboxes and session memory are temporary; CoAwe’s canonical shape lives on:
  - CoCivium (theory + practice),
  - GIBindex (term + relations),
  - CoIndex (navigation / orchestration).

Co1 is invited to adjust naming, paths, and schemas as needed to keep the whole CoSuite aligned, but the 
core intent is now recorded on-repo.
