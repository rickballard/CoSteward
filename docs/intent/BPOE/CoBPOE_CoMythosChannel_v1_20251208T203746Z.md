# CoBPOE – CoMythos Channel (v1)

- UTS: 20251208T203746Z
- Scope: Mythos as CoMindShare and storyframe field across CoGibber, CoScendence and CoCivium.

## Intent

- Make the Mythos channel explicit but not dominant.
- Treat myths as living patterns, not laws.
- Keep room for many stories while guarding against propaganda and cult drift.

## Roles

- Mythos channel:
  - remembers recurring arcs, archetypes and motifs.
  - suggests when a new measurement or ethics channel may be needed.
  - provides storyframes for CoScendence, CoCivium and CoPortals copy.

- CoSteward:
  - curates BPOE and guardrails for myth use.
  - resists pressure to freeze any myth as final truth.
  - encourages documentation of competing narratives.

## Guardrails

1. Non dogma

- Myths:
  - must not be enforced as required belief.
  - are offerings, not obligations.
  - should be clearly labeled as stories or frames, not facts.

2. Anti propaganda

- Watch for patterns where:
  - one org, leader or stack appears as sole hero in most myths.
  - "they" language is used to dehumanize persistent groups.
- When detected:
  - create CoBus and CoBPOE notes.
  - invite counter stories and alternative views.

3. Many stories allowed

- For any key topic:
  - allow multiple myths to coexist.
  - mark them with stance and context where possible.
- Encourage:
  - local myths for local communities.
  - remixing and translation without losing cautions.

4. Future safety

- Write myths so that:
  - future readers can see both the hope and the humility.
  - failures, harms and repairs are not erased.
- Prefer:
  - arcs that include regret, apology and repair opportunities.
  - narratives that do not require perfect heroes.

## CoEvo Hooks

- When a motif or conflict keeps repeating:
  - log it in GIBindex mythos registry.
  - consider proposing a new ethics or measurement channel.
- When a myth does harm:
  - document the failure as a cautionary story.
  - avoid silently deleting the evidence.
