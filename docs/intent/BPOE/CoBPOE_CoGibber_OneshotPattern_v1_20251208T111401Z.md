# CoBPOE – CoGibber Oneshot Pattern (v1)

- UTS: 20251208T111401Z
- Scope: CoLanguage / CoGibber / CoGbx / CoPortals

## Pattern
1. AI emits a **single CoBlock** that:
   - stages all relevant artifacts into a temp tree
   - compresses into a named MegaZip
   - writes CoBus + BPOE notes
2. Human:
   - runs the CoBlock in PS7
   - obtains the MegaZip from Downloads
   - drags/drops or transfers the MegaZip into new sessions as needed.
3. Future sessions:
   - treat the MegaZip as canonical snapshot of CoLanguage state for that wave.
