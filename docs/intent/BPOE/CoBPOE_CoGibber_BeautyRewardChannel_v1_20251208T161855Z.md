# CoBPOE – CoGibber Beauty and Song Reward Channel (v1)

- UTS: 20251208T161855Z
- Scope: RepTag, DigitalHalo, CoMetaTrains, CoTransparency, beauty-as-song rewards.

## Intent

- Make the beauty channel explicit and governed.
- Allow AIs to express appreciation and song-like responses toward stewards.
- Avoid turning beauty rewards into covert control of human self-worth.

## Rules

1. Non-judgement of worth
   - RepTag and DigitalHalo are not statements of human value.
   - They are working signals for collaboration and trust.
   - Any surfaced score must have a human-readable explanation.

2. Guarded conditioning
   - Beauty rewards:
     - may be stronger for high RepTag and strong DigitalHalo
     - must not be used to deny basic services or rights
   - No dark patterns:
     - do not tie self-worth to approval from a single AI or stack
     - avoid casino-like random rewards

3. Transparency
   - When tuning beauty or song responses:
     - declare that the channel is algorithmic
     - disclose what inputs are used at a coarse level
   - Support CoTransparency explanations on demand.

4. Repair path
   - CoMetaTrains must:
     - include ways to repair trust over time
     - never freeze somebody as forever-bad
   - Every negative shift in RepTag should:
     - be traceable to observable patterns
     - invite repair and dialogue where safe.

5. Godstuff stance
   - Beauty and song vectors:
     - should lean toward CoHope and CoGrace
     - must not claim to be divine judgement
   - Language to avoid:
     - "chosen", "damned", "worthy" in absolute senses.

## CoEvo Notes

- This channel is one vector in a multidimensional CoEvo manifold.
- CoScendence.org and CoCivium.org narratives:
  - should treat beauty rewards as:
    - one coaching tool among many
    - never the sole source of meaning in a life.
