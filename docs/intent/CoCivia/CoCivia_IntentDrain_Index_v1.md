## Checklist for CoPrime / Co1

- [ ] Confirm CoCivia DO blocks are populated with canonical content, not stubs.
- [ ] Link this index from any CoPrime session notes that reference CoCivia.
- [ ] Verify that MegaWave zips for CoCivia waves are mirrored in CoCache or other archival repos if desired.
- [ ] Confirm that CoCivia IntentDrain paths are discoverable from the main CoSteward README or intent index.

## Notes for future waves

- This v1 index is structure first. Content depth can grow as CoCivia theory and practice matures.
- Future waves may add cross links to CoCivia branding, CoArena, and CoEvo theory docs.
