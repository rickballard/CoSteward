## 1. What CoSteward should know

**CoMetaEvolution** is the domain that governs how evolution itself is
steered inside CoCivium.

It answers:

> Given the observable behaviour of humans, AIs, and sessions, how should
> the rules of evolution adapt?

Operational impact for CoSteward:

- decides which session outputs deserve long-term capture  
- protects plurality and creativity  
- prevents runaway or weaponized evolution  
- respects CoLegal and CoAudit rails

## 2. Where the canonical docs live

- Spine: CoCivium/docs/domains/CoMetaEvolution/CoMetaEvolution_Spine_v1.md  
- Theory: CoCivium/docs/domains/CoMetaEvolution/theory_v1.md  
- Practice: CoCivium/docs/domains/CoMetaEvolution/practice_v1.md

When in doubt about whether a session’s content should become a long-term
asset, stewards should consult the **Practice** file first.

## 3. How CoSteward and sessions should use it

Default checklist for potential meta-capture:

1. Is the idea reusable beyond this session?  
2. Would future stewards or contributors benefit from seeing it?  
3. Does it touch identity, trust, civars, or governance rails?  
4. Does it widen or clarify the CoOptionSpace?  
5. Is it safe and in-bounds legally?

If most answers to 1–4 are “yes” and 5 is “yes”, treat the idea as a
candidate for CoMetaEvolution capture and suggest a target domain or
insight pair.
