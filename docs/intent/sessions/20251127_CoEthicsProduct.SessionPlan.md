# CoEthics Product — Session Plan (v0)

- **Session label:** CoEthicsProduct
- **Local date:** 2025-11-27
- **Status:** v0 / seed
- **Repos:** CoCivium (product docs), CoSteward (rails/BPOE/session)

## 1. Mission (one sentence)

Shape and hand off a free-to-world **CoEthics** product seed that helps
people compare how they spend their **cash** and **viewing time** across
brands and content, aligned with ethical / impact lenses.

## 2. Context and prior waves

This session builds on:

- CoEthicsGauge v0 (kit, log, entries, dashboard, tools).
- Academia Shock ↔ CoEthicsGauge linkage stub.
- CoEthics IntegrityMap Strategic Advisory Addendum.
- CoBadLand BPOE: runner-first MegaWave behaviour when downloads are flaky.

Together these form the **governance + metrics backbone** for a future
consumer-facing CoEthics product.

## 3. This session’s MegaWave map (v0)

| # | Wave                                      | Summary                                                   | Repo(s)    | Status |
|---|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | CoEthics Product SessionPlan (this file)  | Capture mission, scope, and wave map                      | CoSteward | TODO   |
| 2 | CoEthics Product v0 concept doc           | Free-to-world product framing + flows (cash & attention)  | CoCivium  | TODO   |
| 3 | CoEthics Product CoSync snapshot          | CoSync note tying CoEthics product seed into rails        | CoSteward | TODO   |

Later sessions may extend this with implementation waves (API, UI, data
feeds, etc.), but this session focuses on **concept + rails**.

## 4. Product seed outline (v0)

### 4.1 Primary user stories

- "I want to know which brands deserve more of my **money**."
- "I want to know which platforms/creators deserve more of my **attention**."
- "I want a quick way to see **trade-offs** (e.g., price vs ethics vs impact)."

### 4.2 Early deliverables (this session)

- CoEthics Product v0 concept doc in CoCivium:
  - Defines inputs (brands, content, lenses).
  - Describes outputs (scorecards, watchlists, “better swaps” suggestions).
  - Connects explicitly to CoEthicsGauge / CoEthics docs.
- CoSync note in CoSteward with pointers for Co1/HP:
  - Where the product doc lives,
  - Which branches/PRs carry the seed,
  - How future sessions can extend it.

## 5. Intent checklist (v0)

- [ ] This Session Plan merged (or PR open + referenced) in CoSteward.
- [ ] CoEthics Product v0 concept doc exists in CoCivium/docs/CoEthics.
- [ ] Concept doc clearly ties to CoEthicsGauge + advisory addendum.
- [ ] CoSync note written, with pointers + next-step suggestions for productization.
- [ ] At least one suggestion recorded for licensing / “free-to-world” posture (MIT/AGPL/TBD).

## 6. Receipts (to be filled in)

_Add PRs, branches, and CoSync notes here as the waves land._
