# CoPrime Session  -  CoCivia IntentDrain (v0)

> **Companion to:** `CoPrime_Session_CoCivia_v0.md`  
> **Wave hub:** MW_CoCivia_SessionChecklistIntentDrain_v0  
> **Role:** capture *all* high-signal CoCivia learnings so they do not die with chat.

This file is deliberately rough and append-only.  
Think of it as the **session’s scratchpad of wisdom** that must eventually land in:

- BPOE docs (CoSteward, CoCache, CoRef, etc.),  
- product specs (CoAgent / CoArena / CoCivium),  
- public-facing narratives (RickPublic, CoCivium.org, CoPolitic.org).

When in doubt: **log the thought here, then refine later**.

---

## 1. Log format

Each entry should roughly look like:

```markdown
## [WaveID] Short label (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Repo targets:** CoSteward, CoCacheGlobal, CoAgent, CoCivium  
**Signal:** 1–5  (5 = extremely important, 1 = minor)  

**What we learned:**  
- bullet(s) here

**Where it should land later:**  
- specific files or repos, if known
```

Feel free to be pragmatic  -  partial info is better than silence.

## 2. Seed entries (examples)

These are intentionally sketchy; refine or replace as waves progress.

### 2.1 [MW_CoCivia_SessionPlan_v0] CoCivia as everywoman AI-entry

**Repo targets:** CoSteward (session docs, BPOE), CoCacheGlobal (CoCivia home/index)  
**Signal:** 5  

**What we learned (seed):**

- CoCivia should feel like an **everywoman bridge** between everyday humans and the dense CoCivium stack.
- Visuals should be **intentionally blurred**, mixing ethnicities and micro-expressions so no single identity dominates.
- CoCivia sits at the **front door of trust**: she is where people first decide whether CoSuite feels safe and worth their time.
- The *correct* level of mystery: enough abstraction to be archetypal, but enough warmth to feel like a genuine presence.

**Where it should land later (seed):**

- Persona + positioning docs in CoCacheGlobal and CoAgent branding folders.
- Public copy on CoCivium / CoAgent / CoArena entry pages.
- AI-entry BPOE in CoSteward for all CoSuite products.

### 2.2 [MW_CoCivia_SessionChecklistIntentDrain_v0] MegaWave discipline for persona work

**Repo targets:** CoSteward (MegaWave BPOE), CoCache (CoEvo / CoProcess docs)  
**Signal:** 4  

**What we learned (seed):**

- Even “soft” work like personas and visuals **benefits from strict MegaWave rails** (zips, receipts, PRs).
- Session-specific docs (like this IntentDrain) should always be **paired** with a more structured checklist doc.
- Drift risk is highest in visual/brand work; rails reduce the chance that “vibes” stay only in chat.

**Where it should land later (seed):**

- Updates to CoPrime_SessionPlan_MegaWaves_v0 to reference persona/brand-specific patterns.
- Guidance to Dia/graphics repos on how to treat AI-generated moodboards and reference sets.

## 3. Open slots for future waves

> Use these headings as **pre-made slots**; edit, replace, or expand as needed.

### 3.1 [MW_CoCivia_PersonaSeed_v0] TBD

*(Fill in once persona wave runs.)*

### 3.2 [MW_CoCivia_TrustReceipts_v0] TBD

*(Fill in once trust receipts are drafted.)*

### 3.3 [MW_CoCivia_AssetIndex_v0] TBD

*(Fill in once asset index is created.)*

### 3.4 [MW_CoCivia_Closeout_v0] TBD

*(Final sweep + next-session prescription.)*

## 4. Closeout ritual (for later)

When ready to close the CoCivia session for this cycle:

1. Ensure **every high-signal idea** mentioned in chat has either:  
   - landed on repo in a structured doc, **or**  
   - been logged here with enough context that a future wave can do so.

2. Add a short **"Next RX"** subsection under the Closeout wave with:  
   - recommended next wave IDs,  
   - which repos should wake up next,  
   - any humans that should be looped in (e.g., Dia designers, outreach recipients).

3. Confirm there is a **CoSync note** in CoSteward under  
   `docs/intent/advice/notes/YYYYMMDD/` referencing this session and key waves.

Until then, treat this file as your **safety net** for CoCivia-related insight.
