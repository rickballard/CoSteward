# CoPrime Session  -  CoCivia (v0)

> **Session label:** "CoCivia"  
> **Wave hub:** MW_CoCivia_SessionChecklistIntentDrain_v0  
> **Owner:** Rick / CoPrime  
> **Repos in scope:** CoSteward, CoCacheGlobal, CoAgent, CoCache, CoCivium, CoCivium-website (and friends)

This document is the **session-local hub** for all CoCivia work in this chat series.  
It is deliberately lightweight and checklisted so that:

* CoPrime can see, at a glance, **what this session is for**.  
* Every MegaWave can **attach itself** via receipts.  
* Future sessions can **drain remaining wisdom** before closure.

---

## 1. Session Purpose (CoCivia)

CoCivia is the **everywoman AI-entry archetype** for CoSuite:

* a soft, welcoming **front door** for humans who don't yet speak "CoCivium".
* an "almost not there" presence in visuals  -  blurred, shifting identity, many-lived.
* a narrative glue between: CoAgent, CoArena, CoCivium.org, RickPublic, CoPolitic.

This session focuses on:

1. **Hardening CoCivia as a concept** (persona, promises, boundaries).  
2. **Aligning assets on repo** (index, home, receipts, usage/positioning docs).  
3. **Preparing for visual + video assets** that Dia/graphics sessions can consume.  
4. **Capturing all learnings** into BPOE-style docs so nothing is lost when chat ends.

## 2. MegaWave Checklist (CoCivia Session)

> Target: keep the **number of waves small but dense**, and keep this list honest.

## 3. Intent Checklist (per-wave)

This is intentionally redundant with the table above  -  it is tuned for **checkbox UX** in GitHub.

### 3.1 MW_CoCivia_SessionPlan_v0  ✅ (landed)

- [x] Seed CoCivia session hub doc in CoSteward under `docs/intent/sessions/`.  
- [x] Describe high-level purpose of CoCivia in the ecosystem.  
- [x] Wire this session into the general CoPrime SessionPlan/MegaWave rails.  
- [x] Add CoStatus bump + receipts wave (done in prior waves).  

### 3.2 MW_CoCivia_SessionChecklistIntentDrain_v0  ✅ (this wave, once merged)

- [ ] Add explicit MegaWave checklist (this file, section 2).  
- [ ] Add IntentDrain stub doc (`CoPrime_Session_CoCivia_IntentDrain_v0.md`).  
- [ ] Ensure both docs are referenced by CoPrime session-plan MegaWave doc.  
- [ ] Open PR and confirm CoStatus bump with updated MW label.  

> After merge: tick these boxes and, if helpful, include PR number(s) inline.

### 3.3 MW_CoCivia_PersonaSeed_v0  ⬜

- [ ] Draft CoCivia persona: voice, tone, boundaries, and "what she will not do".  
- [ ] Explain relationship between CoCivia and Rick (trust chain, authorship).  
- [ ] Provide 3–5 **example dialogues** showing CoCivia in action.  
- [ ] Link to any existing CoCivia assets in CoCacheGlobal / CoAgent / CoCivium.  

### 3.4 MW_CoCivia_TrustReceipts_v0  ⬜

- [ ] Document CoCivia’s **promises and disclaimers** to users.  
- [ ] Enumerate failure modes (misuse, over-trust, hallucinations) and responses.  
- [ ] Define how CoCivia should surface **receipts** to reassure cautious users.  
- [ ] Cross-link to CoStatus, CoAudit, and any relevant guardrail docs.  

### 3.5 MW_CoCivia_AssetIndex_v0  ⬜

- [ ] Create a simple index of CoCivia-related docs across repos.  
- [ ] Include links to branding, avatar usage, positioning, receipts, and session docs.  
- [ ] Add a short section on **how Dia/graphics sessions should consume this index**.  
- [ ] Ensure index is concept-rooted enough for GIBindex/CoRef later.  

### 3.6 MW_CoCivia_Closeout_v0  ⬜

- [ ] Sweep IntentDrain doc, ensuring all high-signal ideas are on repo.  
- [ ] Mark any **unlanded** work as explicit carry-over items for Co1 / future sessions.  
- [ ] Add a brief retrospective: “What we learned about CoCivia this round.”  
- [ ] Append final CoSync note + receipts for archival.

## 4. How future sessions should use this doc

1. **At session start**, skim this file to see:  
   - what the CoCivia session was for,  
   - which waves are done,  
   - where to drain remaining wisdom.  

2. **When planning a new wave**, add it here *and* in the IntentDrain doc so that the  
   "what we plan" and "what we learned" sides stay paired.

3. **Never rely on chat memory alone.**  
   If something feels like a **new insight about CoCivia**, log it into the IntentDrain doc and/or into the appropriate wave’s checklist items.

4. Before declaring the CoCivia session **fully closed**:  
   - ensure **all checkboxes that *should* be ticked are ticked**,  
   - leave a small "Next RX" section in the Closeout wave for whoever picks this up next.

## 5. Session-local quick-links

These paths are **relative to CoSteward repo**:

- `docs/intent/sessions/CoPrime_Session_CoCivia_v0.md`  (this file)  
- `docs/intent/sessions/CoPrime_Session_CoCivia_IntentDrain_v0.md`  (wisdom drain log)  
- `docs/ops/MegaWave/CoPrime_SessionPlan_MegaWaves_v0.md`  (global session-plan BPOE)  

For non-CoSteward assets (branding, CoCivia home, etc.), prefer to track them in the  
**AssetIndex** wave once created.
