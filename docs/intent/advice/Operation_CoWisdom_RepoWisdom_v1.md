# Operation CoWisdom – RepoWisdom (v1 stub)

This advisory anchors the **CoWisdom / repo-wisdom** pattern in CoSteward and
points at the canonical operation file in **CoIndex**:

- `CoIndex/docs/CoWisdom/Operation_RepoWisdom_CoCourier_v1.md`

Treat that CoIndex document as the *spec + playbook*. This CoSteward note:

- explains why BPOE treats "off-repo" wisdom as non-canonical,
- reminds sessions to land high-value wisdom assets on repo,
- can be extended by Co1 / CoPrime in later waves with status notes,
  links to dashboards, and CoWisdom metrics.

If you reached this file from a 404 or search result, the fix is:

1. Make sure both paths above exist at HEAD.
2. Refresh any external links or bookmarks to use the GitHub URLs at HEAD.
