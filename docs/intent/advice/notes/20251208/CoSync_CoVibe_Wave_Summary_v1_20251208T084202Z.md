## 2. How to read CoVibe
High level:
- **CoVibe** describes the felt style of:
  - CoVoice (how replies sound),
  - CoStyle (format, pacing, density),
  - CoBrand (how CoCivium feels as a presence),
  - CoTerms (which words we favour, avoid, or define).
- The **protocol** file is the main reference for:
  - naming and tuning CoVibeLevels,
  - guiding future sessions on how to keep tone coherent.
- The **GIB term** makes CoVibe a first class concept in CoIndex.
- The **CoBus notice** lets orchestration and Co1 know these rails exist.

## 3. Hooks for Co1 and future sessions
Suggested uses:
- Use CoVibe as a quick way to:
  - describe session tone at start of a MegaWave,
  - compare current session tone vs desired tone,
  - give contributors a small set of sliders (pace, density, formality).
- Co1 can:
  - reference CoVibe in onboarding notes,
  - let CoAgent / CoArena panels surface a simple CoVibeLevel selector.
