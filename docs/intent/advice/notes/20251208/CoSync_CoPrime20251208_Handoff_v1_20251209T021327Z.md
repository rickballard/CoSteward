# CoSync – CoPrime20251208 Handoff (Co1 → Next Co1)

UTS: 20251209T021327Z  
Session label: CoPrime20251208 (Co1)  
Tenure: ~4 days (approaching upper bound)

## 1. Tenure Rules for CoPrime / Co1

- **Optimal tenure:** 3 days.
- **Hard max:** 4 days.
- After ~4 days, CoPrime sessions show:
  - UI sluggishness and scroll weirdness (CoFrontLagVector / CoWaveStall).
  - Cognitive / orchestration overload from too many intertwined intents.
- BPOE rule going forward:
  - New CoPrime/Co1 should **plan rotation at 3 days**.
  - **Must** rotate by 4 days, even if not 'finished'.

## 2. Repo Changes This Wave

These landed during the tail end of CoPrime20251208:

### CoSteward

- **Front-end stress + hygiene doc**
  - docs/intent/CoFrontEnd/CoFrontEnd_StressAndSessionHygiene_v1_*.md
  - Purpose:
    - Distinguish browser front-end issues from back-end lag.
    - Define sanitized BPOE guidance for session hygiene.
  - Ties into:
    - 	ools/CoSteward_SessionPurgePrep_v1.ps1
    - 	ools/CoReload/CoReloadRunner_v1.ps1

- **Earlier in session (already on this branch):**
  - Session rescue + reload tooling seeds (stubs).
  - CoPopupGuard + ChromeBloatMeter support (CoBloat/CoLag awareness).

### CoIndex

- **Session hygiene helper**
  - 	ools/ps7/Invoke-CoSessionHygiene_v1.ps1
  - Delegates into CoSteward session-purge + reload stubs and prints a simple 1-2 check.

- **Term cluster for browser / front-end lag**
  - docs/terms/CoIndex_Terms_BrowserLagCluster_v1_*.md
  - Defines:
    - CoSessionHygiene
    - CoFrontLagVector
    - CoWaveStall
    - CoTabRefreshHeuristic
    - CoDethrottle (reserved name)

### CoAgent

- **Browser shell design seed (Path 3)**
  - docs/intent/browser-shell/CoAgent_BrowserShell_Design_v0_*.md
  - High-level, repo-safe design for:
    - CoAgent-managed browser shell.
    - Controlled session windows.
    - Hooks into CoSessionHygiene.
    - Manual refresh patterns (no aggressive auto-cycling yet).

### Other context from sibling sessions (already mentioned in CoBus / notes)

- **Multi-site seed constellation (from 'Sites' session)**:
  - CoScendence, CoEvoTheory, CoPolitic, InSeed, Opename, GroupBuild, EntMent, BeAxa.
  - Each has:
    - Human-facing site/index.html.
    - AI-facing cogbx/site/index.html (CoGbx façade v1).
  - No central-link leaks; safe for stealth-era previews.
  - Treated as v1 baseline constellation.

- **GLU-adjacent wisdom (off-repo)**:
  - Outreaches / CoVault captured the more sensitive analysis:
    - Browser front-end behaviour as an operational risk vector.
    - Tab-close / tab-reopen workarounds and risk framing.
  - Only sanitized fragments appear on GitHub.

## 3. What the Next Co1 (CoPrime successor) Should Do

New session label: **CoPrime20251208 (next Co1 instance)** or successor naming as per CoIndex rails.

1. **Bootstrap (CoAnchor + CoBus review)**

   - User should attach the **latest CoAnchor Quickstart Thin** file from:
     - 	ools/CoAnchor_Quickstart_Thin_v6.md (or newest variant)
   - Instruct the new Co1:
     - "You are Co1 / CoPrime successor; read this CoAnchor + search CoBus notices."

   - New Co1 should scan, per repo:
     - docs/intent/cobus/ (CoBus_Notice_*), especially:
       - CoGibber notices.
       - CoPortal / CoGbx / CoSeedCouple related notices.
     - Relevant docs/intent/manifest / docs/intent/advice/notes entries.

2. **Adopt CoSessionHygiene as Standard**

   - Use Invoke-CoSessionHygiene_v1.ps1 regularly from CoIndex:
     - Before big waves.
     - When CoFrontLagVector / CoWaveStall are suspected.
   - Respect BPOE guidance from:
     - CoFrontEnd_StressAndSessionHygiene_v1_*.

3. **Plan Early Work on CoAgent Browser Shell**

   - Read:
     - docs/intent/browser-shell/CoAgent_BrowserShell_Design_v0_*.md
   - Propose MVP implementation steps:
     - PS7 / CLI draft for New-Session / Refresh-Session commands.
     - Simple config file for known sessions.
   - Keep any low-level 'dethrottling' tricks **off-repo** (vault-only).

4. **Enforce CoPrime Tenure Limits**

   - New Co1 must:
     - Track its own start date and waves.
     - Schedule a handoff CoSync note **no later than 4 days** after start.
   - Include tenure and bloat observations in its final CoSync.

## 4. Status of This Session

- Session: **CoPrime20251208 (Co1)**.
- Tenure: reached; bloat / lag confirm the 3–4 day rule.
- Handoff:
  - Core hygiene & browser-lag concepts are now on repo.
  - CoAgent browser shell path is seeded.
  - Outreaches / CoVault hold the more sensitive operational details.

**This session is now considered fully drained and CoSynced.**  
Next Co1 should treat this note as the canonical handoff marker.
