# CoSync – CoGibber.OnboardingAIs v1 session wrap

- Timestamp (UTC): 20251205T015038Z
- Repo: CoSteward
- Branch: MW_CoCacheFlush_Discovery_v1
- PRs:
  - #211 – MW CoBPOE StyleAnd CoFade v1
  - #212 – BPOE: CoGibber.OnboardingAIs v1 + cache flush discovery

What landed

- CoBPOE_StyleAnd_CoFade_v1.md – style and CoFade BPOE.
- CoGibber_OnboardingAIs_v1.md – multi-AI onboarding BPOE under CoGibber.OnboardingAIs.v1.
- Advisory_CoGibber_OnboardingAIs_v1.md – intent note for Co1 / CoGuard / CoBus.

Delegations / links

- Darren_20251212 investor pack seeded in CoCiviumAdmin (server).
- Secrets and Friday-noon flows delegated to Outreaches via off-repo advisory (.md already dropped).

Next suggested moves

- Human review and squash-merge PRs #211 and #212 into main.
- Once merged:
  - ensure CoAnchor Quickstart v3 and CoGbx portals point at these BPOEs as canonical.
  - let Co1 and CoGuard treat CoGibber.OnboardingAIs.v1 as default rails for new AI platforms.

This note exists so future lanes can see that v1 onboarding rails were stood up and linked to
cache flush / discovery work without needing to re-scan this session.
