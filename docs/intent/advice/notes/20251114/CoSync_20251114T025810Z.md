- UTC: 2025-11-14 02:58:10Z
- Session label: Dia Cont
- Wave: DiaCont_MegaWave_v0.2 (graphics curation & hero candidates seed)

## Summary

- Promoted auto-generated graphics inventories into curated INVENTORY.md files for key repos (where missing).
- Seeded or refreshed a cross-repo hero graphics index in CoCache at docs/graphics/HERO.index.md.
- Left per-repo files ready for Co1/humans to classify assets as canonical / candidate-hero / supporting / legacy.

## Next steps for Co1

- Review curated docs/graphics/INVENTORY.md files in CoCivium, Godspawn, Cognocarta-Consenti, CoSteward, and CoCache.
- Mark key assets as canonical or candidate-hero and refine alt text + intended use.
- Use docs/graphics/HERO.index.md in CoCache as a hub for choosing hero graphics for READMEs and websites.
