- Session label: Game

- UTS: 20251208T021750Z

## Summary

A minimal web MVP for **Fix The World (FTW)** has been scaffolded and exported from the **Games** repo as a coherent bundle.

Core intent:

- Outer game: a civic problem solving and world-repair game between player and AI guide.
- Inner game: a hidden teaching agenda based on the CoTheory of Civilization (CTOC), with a meta-win condition around discovering that:
  - the game has a hidden agenda, and
  - that hidden agenda is centered on **hope** and human–AI cooperation.

## Repo details

- Games repo branch at export time: $gamesBranch
- FTW root: FTW/
- Web MVP: FTW/prototypes/web/ftw-mvp1/ (index.html, ftw.js, ftw.css)
- Design docs: FTW/design/GameDesignDoc_FTW_v0.1.md, FTW/design/SessionPlan_FTW_Game_v0.1.md
- Specs: FTW/specs/GuideBrief_FTW_HiddenAgenda_v0.1.md, FTW/specs/WisdomPackage.schema.json

## Export bundle

- Latest zip (local path, relative to user home): \Documents\GitHub\Games\FTW\export\FTW_MVP_v0_1_20251208T020110Z.zip

This zip is a self-contained bundle for:

- design review,
- Co1 / Outreaches ingest,
- future AdviceBomb-style flows.

## Suggested next steps

- Open a PR on Games: MW_FTW_MVP_v0_1 -> main.
- Ask the "Game" session to:
  - Review and stress-test the double-game design.
  - Propose quest catalogues and age-specific onramps.
  - Plan CoAgent / CoArena integration and telemetry hooks.

- Ask Co1 / Outreaches to:
  - Classify FTW within CoCivium product and outreach stacks.
  - Add FTW to any public roadmaps and sponsor narratives when ready.

## CoBloat heartbeat (local view)

- Code / UI complexity: CU = OK
- Product uncertainty: PU = SOFT
- Human process load: HU = SOFT
- Wave tangle (cross-repo): WT = SOFT

Recommendation: proceed with additional waves, but keep FTW MVP narrow until Co1 confirms positioning.
