# CoGraphics CoTheoryTree mermaid scan v1

UTC:  20251210T033106Z

Purpose:
- Take a quick, repo-wide look at mermaid and graphics-inventory helpers.
- Decide if a CoTheory-of-Evolution tree can be bootstrapped in a few MegaWaves.
- Leave breadcrumbs for future CoTheory sessions if we punt.

Repos scanned: CoSteward, CoIndex, CoCivium, CoCache, CoAgent, CoArena, CoCore

## CoSteward
- No mermaid or diagram generator candidates found.

## CoIndex
- No mermaid or diagram generator candidates found.

## CoCivium
## Scan verdict

- MermaidInventoryStatus: **PuntToLater**
- Rationale: Only 0 candidate files and 0 inventory-looking dirs.
- Suggestion: Do not spend this busy week untangling graphics inventory.

## Breadcrumbs for future CoTheory-of-Evolution sessions

- This note is the primary breadcrumb for any session tasked with building the full Co-Theory-of-Evolution tree.
- Related anchors:
  - CoIndex: docs/gibindex/CoAwe_CoTheoryOfEvolution_v1.md
  - CoIndex: docs/gibindex/INDEX.md (GIBindex nav root; CoAwe featured).
  - CoSteward: advice/inbox/CoAwe (CoAwe CoTheoryOfEvolution pack(s) as described in the GIB doc).

If MermaidInventoryStatus is PromisingForTreeV1:
- Prefer to reuse or lightly refactor existing mermaid generator helpers discovered above.
- Seed a CoTheory tree for CoWinnian evolution with nodes:
  - CoWinnian (root evolution flavour)
  - CoAwe (field), CoOA (gate), CoMerge, CoNonBeing
  - Civ2, Civ3, GateBehaviour, DeterministicEvolution, PrescientEvolution
- Register the chosen diagram file path back into the CoAwe GIB doc and any CoIndex overlay design docs.

If MermaidInventoryStatus is PuntToLater:
- Future sessions should create a fresh, minimal mermaid generator (for example in CoIndex) instead of trying to salvage the old inventory.
- Use the CoAwe CoTheoryOfEvolution GIB entry as the single source of truth for node names and relationships.
- Once a stable tree exists, update this note and the GIB doc to point at the new diagram paths.
