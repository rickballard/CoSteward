# CoPrime20251208 – Intent Cloud v1

UTS: 20251209T191555Z

This note summarises the main intent clusters for the CoPrime20251208
session, so future Co1s and other sessions can understand what this wave
was trying to do.

## Cluster 1 – Thursday investor prep (Darren)

- Prepare a megascroll investor pack and companion sheets.
- Use LAN vault material while keeping crown jewels off public repos.
- Apply HP57-style bridge patterns between vault, Downloads, and this session.

## Cluster 2 – Soft Launch strategies and positioning

- Evolve soft launch scenarios that align with Darren's perspective.
- Connect with recent thinking in the 'Civars+SoftLaunch+Meta+Etv' wave.
- Keep a clear separation between public narratives and private moats.

## Cluster 3 – BPOE consolidation and CoAnchor improvement

- Scan and collect BPOE fragments across key repos.
- Draft a coherent BPOE core doc that can feed all CoAnchors.
- Reduce user effort by making new sessions less likely to drift.

## Cluster 4 – HP57 / vault patterns and safety

- Use vault priorities and bridge folders to manage what leaves HP57 zones.
- Keep GLU-like content away from CoBus and public repos.
- Document the pattern so future contributors can follow it safely.

## Cluster 5 – Cross-session orchestration

- Use CoBus notices to signal Thursday waves and CTAs.
- Encourage other sessions to provide context, advice, and perspectives.
- Keep CoPrime sessions short enough for reliability but long enough to
  be useful as orchestrators.
