# CoPrime20251208 – Thursday Prep Session Plan v1

UTS: 20251209T185138Z

This note captures the Thursday-focused wave for CoPrime20251208 (Co1).
It is meta only; all sensitive content remains in the vault and HP57-style
bridges. Use this as a guide for this session and for future Co1s picking
up after rotation.

## Context

- Near-term meeting with Darren has moved earlier (Thursday, late afternoon or
  evening).
- Primary source material lives in the vault handoff:
  - \\Server\CoCiviumAdmin\VaultHandoff\Darren20251212
  - Priorities sheet: Vault_Darren20251212_Priorities_v1_20251209T153007Z.md
- Repo must avoid GLU content and other crown jewels. Vault and local LAN hold
  the real details.

## Phase 1 – Vault triage and HP57 bridge

- Use the vault priorities sheet to classify each file:
  - Lane: VaultOnly | RepoSafe
  - Priority: P0, P1, P2, P3
- Mark only material that is both safe for repo and needed for Thursday as:
  - Lane = RepoSafe
  - Priority = P0 or P1
- Rerun the export helper:
  - CoPrime20251208_Co1_Vault_Darren20251212_Export_RepoSafe_P0P1_v2_UTS
- Human step:
  - Review Downloads\\Thursday_Darren20251212\\RepoSafe_P0P1_* and the zip.
  - If comfortable, upload the zip into the Thursday-focused session for AI-side
    drafting and packaging.

## Phase 2 – Thursday deliverables

Planned printed deliverables:

1. Megascroll investor pack (one big PDF):
   - Problem and context.
   - CoCivium and CoSuite overview.
   - Darren lens: how he fits, options, and alignment scenarios.
   - Redacted explanation of moats and architecture (no GLU specifics).
   - Roadmap and soft launch strategy.
   - Governance, trust, and risk framing.
   - Ask and proposed next steps.

2. Companion sheets:
   - One page Darren summary.
   - Soft launch scenarios cheat sheet.
   - High level IP and moat note with sensitive details redacted.

3. Internal session-only assets (not printed yet):
   - Draft claim frameworks and IP outlines.
   - Talk track outline for the Thursday conversation.

## Phase 3 – CoBus beacons (meta only)

- Use CoBus notices in CoSteward to:
  - Mark that there is a Thursday investor prep wave driven by vault material.
  - Record that details stay in LAN vault and HP57 bridges, not on repo.
  - Point future Co1s at:
    - Vault priorities sheet.
    - Thursday bridge folders under Downloads.
    - This ThursdayPrep session plan note.
- Do not include any GLU-typed details or vault file names beyond what is
  already safe in the priorities sheet.

## Phase 4 – Session tenure and handoff

- CoPrime20251208 should:
  - Stay within a 3 to 4 day tenure where possible.
  - Write a final CoSync note when handing off to the next Co1.
  - Leave clear pointers to:
    - The latest ThursdayPrep plan note.
    - The latest CoBus notices for this wave.
    - Any remaining vault priorities that need work.

End of plan.
