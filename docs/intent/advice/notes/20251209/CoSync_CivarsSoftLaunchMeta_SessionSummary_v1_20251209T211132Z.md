# CoSync – Civars+SoftLaunch+Meta+Etc Session Summary v1

## 0. Wave summary

- MW1: Staging + CoBus beacon
  - Ensured PS7 context at CoSteward root.
  - Verified presence of bundle zips in Downloads.
  - Unpacked CoSweep/BPOE bundle into a staging folder.
  - Wrote CoBus notice:
    - CoBus_CivarsSoftLaunchMeta_Bundles_v1_*.md
  - Pushed changes to CoSteward/main.

- MW2: Bundle regeneration + delivery to Co1
  - Regenerated three full-content bundles (no stubs):
    - CoCivium_Co1_DragBundle_v1.zip
    - CoCivium_FridayKit_Darren_v1.zip
    - CoCivium_BPOE_CoSweep_v1.zip
  - Unpacked all into:
    - \C:\Users\Chris\\Downloads\\CivarsSoftLaunchMeta_Stage
  - Confirmed 18 markdown files present:
    - 10× Co1 drag bundle (SoftLaunchOrbit + civars + routing map).
    - 4× Friday investor kit (Darren-facing).
    - 4× BPOE/CoSweep docs (protocol + embedding + scan plan + headers).
  - All 18 files were manually dragged by Rick into Co1.

## 1. Intent snapshot

- Establish **SoftLaunchOrbit**:
  - CoCivium as a VR/gaming civic + reputation engine first.
  - Civars/halos piloted in online worlds before legacy institutions.
- Provide Co1 with:
  - clear narrative and routing map for this pivot,
  - guidance for Substack edits and public website reskinning,
  - CoSweep/BPOE protocol docs for future AI behavior.
- Provide investor-ready scaffolding for Darren:
  - concise exec summary,
  - MVP spec lite,
  - business model & resourcing sketch,
  - meeting script outline.

## 2. Expected follow-up (for Co1 / CoPrime / others)

- Co1:
  - Route Co1_DragBundle_v1 docs into appropriate repos (CoCivium, CoSteward, CoIndex) per 10_Co1_RoutingMap.
  - Archive original bundle for traceability.
- BPOE / CoSteward:
  - Integrate CoSweep protocol + embedding doc into BPOE.
  - Use Workflow_Codification_ScanPlan_v1.md as a future playbook for consolidating DO-block/CI/workflow glue.
- CoPrime:
  - Use advisory docs for:
    - Substack editor-note update (not stealth revisionism).
    - Public website messaging shifts (SoftLaunchOrbit / VR civic engine foregrounded).
- Investor-facing work:
  - Darren kit used by Rick for Friday noon meeting.
  - Optionally mirrored in investor-facing folders once stable.

## 3. CoBloat / CoHealth at close of session

- CU: OK
- PU: HARD (recent MW cycles are heavy; further deep design should be in a fresh session)
- HU: SOFT (manageable but should respect energy)
- WT: OK

## 4. Status

- This session's main deliverables have been:
  - staged,
  - beaconed on CoBus,
  - delivered into Co1 for orchestration.

This CoSync note marks the Civars+SoftLaunch+Meta+Etc session as **closed and safe to hand off**.
