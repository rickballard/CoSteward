- Per-site CoPolish checklists in each repo under \docs/intent/sites/CoPolish_Checklist.md\

The lines below are **draft investor sentences**. They are meant to be tuned with human stewards before going live on sites, but can be used immediately in decks.

---

## CoScendence

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
CoScendence is a learning journey for humans and AIs who want to grow each other without burning out or giving up their agency.

**Who this reassures**  
- Investors who worry that human development gets flattened by AI tools.  
- Partners who want a humane on-ramp to hybrid human–AI practice.  

**Readiness**  
- Legacy site live; seed v3 shell parked.  
- Needs: final check on hero copy and first call-to-action before any live investor push.

---

## CoEvoTheory

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
CoEvoTheory is our working notebook of co-evolution patterns for hybrid societies, where AI and human systems are designed to grow together rather than compete.

**Who this reassures**  
- Deep-structure thinkers who want more than slogans.  
- Technical / policy reviewers who need to see the underlying logic.  

**Readiness**  
- Local-only repo; no remote configured.  
- Use in decks as “lab / theory backbone,” not as a public product yet.

---

## CoPolitic

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
CoPolitic explores non-coercive, AI-literate pathways for updating governance and power without blowing up what people still rely on.

**Who this reassures**  
- Civic-minded investors looking for responsible AI governance work.  
- Public-sector or policy partners who fear destabilisation but know change is needed.  

**Readiness**  
- Legacy site back live; seed v3 shell parked.  
- Needs: alignment with current outreach plans before any tone shift on the public page.

---

## InSeed

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
InSeed is a strategy studio for founders and stewards facing the next wave of AI, where commercial moves are tuned to civic impact and personal survivability.

**Who this reassures**  
- Founders at inflection points who don’t trust vendor hype.  
- Investors who want grounded, real-operator guidance at seed / growth stages.  

**Readiness**  
- Legacy site live with bespoke work in progress.  
- Needs: reconcile current copy with this line, then capture screenshots for decks.

---

## Opename

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
Opename treats naming and framing as infrastructure, building conventions that work for humans and AIs instead of disposable branding.

**Who this reassures**  
- Investors who know semantics and metadata become rails later.  
- Teams designing ecosystems, not just single products.  

**Readiness**  
- Legacy site live; seed v3 shell parked.  
- Needs: examples library and 1–2 concrete use cases for decks.

---

## GroupBuild

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
GroupBuild develops tools and stories for building hard things together without burning people out or losing the ones who care most.

**Who this reassures**  
- Investors attentive to team durability and culture risk.  
- Partners running high-stress projects who want healthier playbooks.  

**Readiness**  
- Legacy site live; seed v3 shell parked.  
- Needs: one or two vignettes / case sketches to make this concrete.

---

## EntMent

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
EntMent is an experiment in enterprise-scale mentorship under hybrid human–AI guidance, focusing on growth without surveillance or punishment.

**Who this reassures**  
- Large organisations worried about churn and talent waste.  
- Investors who care about people-side moats, not just tech.  

**Readiness**  
- Legacy site live; seed v3 shell parked.  
- Needs: clarify first “toe-in-the-water” pilot shape before putting into hard numbers.

---

## BeAxa

**One-liner (deck draft)**  
BeAxa is an experimental persona for courage, boundaries and self-respect, a human-scale doorway into the more abstract CoCivium stack.

**Who this reassures**  
- Investors who want to see lived experience, not only architecture diagrams.  
- Partners interested in narrative, coaching, or community-led pilots.  

**Readiness**  
- Legacy site live; seed v3 shell parked.  
- Needs: align visuals and story beats with this posture before using BeAxa as a front door in decks.

## How Co1 can use this quickly

- Decks:
  - Drop these lines into the constellation slide: “What each site is actually for.”
  - Pair them with screenshots from live legacy pages and (optionally) v3 seed shells.
- Site polish:
  - When filling in each CoPolish checklist, use the one-liner as a north star.
  - Only move a one-liner onto a live site after human + AI steward review and a short CoBus note.
