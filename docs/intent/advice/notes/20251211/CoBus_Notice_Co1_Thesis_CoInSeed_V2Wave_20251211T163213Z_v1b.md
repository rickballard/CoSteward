## New in this wave

From Thesis feature branch feature/Thesis_CoInSeed_Tsunami_20251211T134935Z:

- CoInSeed_Investor2Pager_v2_20251211T145347Z.md
- CoInSeed_Investor_SpeakingNotes_20251211T145347Z.md

These are now committed and pushed as the latest CoInSeed investor v2 spine and
rick speaking notes for live conversations.

Related CoBus entries (same day UTS family):

- CoBus_Thesis_CoInSeed_InvestorFacing_*
- CoBus_Thesis_CoInSeed_PrintPack_*
- CoBus_Thesis_CoInSeed_InvestorPrint_LastChance_*
- CoBus_Sidekick_Thesis_CoInSeed_PostPrint_*

## Current status (short)

- CoInSeed investor v2 2-pager and speaking notes are on repo and branch aligned.
- Print checklist exists under Thesis/docs/CoInSeed.
- Last chance investor print guardrails are captured in CoSteward CoBus notes.
- Sidekick has explicit post print instructions for follow ups.

## Near term intent (hours to days)

- Use CoInSeed_Investor2Pager_v2_* as the print spine for investor handouts.
- Use CoInSeed_Investor_SpeakingNotes_* as rick's talk track for first meetings.
- After the print run, optionally:
  - annotate printed copies with pen and
  - capture any important deltas back into Thesis as v2_used or similar.

Co1 hint:

- Treat this wave as the current CoInSeed investor baseline until a later CoBus
  with a higher UTS explicitly supersedes it.

## Longer range intent (still active)

- Keep using Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/* as the canonical narrative and proof point
  set for CoInSeed.
- Let GIBindex and CoSteward CoBus notes converge toward a reusable CoInSeed
  playbook for steward led AI governance deals.
- Continue to treat CoTsunami as the pattern for large but safe multi repo
  evolution bursts, including investor facing waves like this one.

End of Co1 notice for this CoInSeed v2 wave.
