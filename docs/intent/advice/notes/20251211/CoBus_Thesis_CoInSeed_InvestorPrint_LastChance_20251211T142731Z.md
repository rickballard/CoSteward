## 1. Absolute must-checks before CoInSeed goes to print

These are the non-negotiables Co1 / Sidekick should enforce or flag:

1. **Contact block correctness**
   - Email: contact@InSeed.com
   - Phone: +1.416.414.8100 (mobile)
   - Address: Ballard, 1673 Lakeshore Rd W, Mississauga, ON L5J 1J4
   - Name styling: ick (lowercase) where identity is signaled in CoSuite/CoCivium context.
   - If any legacy contact info remains, flag as a must-fix before print.

2. **Core one-liner is clear and repeatable**
   - Something very close to:
     > We are seeding the operating system for a hybrid human plus AI society and letting a small number of stewards own the upside and the reputation halo.
   - Co1 / Sidekick should ensure:
     - the one-liner appears once in the 2-pager, near the top,
     - language is plain enough for a smart but busy investor,
     - no competing one-line pitches dilute this.

3. **Jargon hygiene for first-read investors**
   - Terms that appear **without** short definition on first use should be treated as bugs:
     - CoCivium, CoSuite, CoInSeed, CoSteward, edge-owned guardrails, hybrid society, CoTsunami.
   - Rule: first appearance = short definition in parentheses or a 1-sentence gloss.
   - Co1 / Sidekick: if any page reads like an internal memo, not a sponsor-facing piece, flag.

4. **Risk and realism**
   - The 2-pager and any print bundle must:
     - acknowledge execution and adoption risk explicitly,
     - avoid implying guaranteed dominance or inevitability,
     - keep analogies (like “early internet protocol work”) but not over-state them.
   - Co1 / Sidekick should highlight any sentence that:
     - promises outcomes outside rick’s direct control,
     - claims inevitable monopoly, or
     - sounds like “saving the world” without grounding.

5. **Deal-shape clarity**
   - Somewhere in the print pack, an investor should be able to answer:
     - What role am I being asked to play? (anchor steward/sponsor, not just cheque-writer)
     - What’s roughly the phase: seed / pre-seed / series-whatever?
     - What is the rough path from today’s repos to institutional pilots?
   - Co1 / Sidekick: if the “ask” is ambiguous or buried, that’s a red flag.

## 2. If there is time for ~15 minutes of edits

If rick has a small editing window before sending to print, prioritize:

1. **Top third of the 2-pager**
   - Ensure:
     - the problem statement is crisp and non-technical,
     - the one-liner is present and polished,
     - the “why now” is framed as timing + inevitability, not panic.

2. **Right-hand column / second half**
   - Make sure:
     - there is at least one box or bullet list that feels like a roadmap or spine,
     - the roles of CoCivium / CoSuite / CoInSeed are each stated in one line.

3. **Contact info + call to action**
   - Clear “next step” line:
     - e.g., “To explore anchor steward roles and CoInSeed participation, contact rick at …”
   - Co1 / Sidekick: prefer a single, clear CTA over multiple vague ones.

---

## 3. If there is time for only ~5 minutes

Co1 / Sidekick should recommend this micro-checklist:

1. Scan for **old contact details** and fix them.
2. Confirm the **one-liner** is present and not hedged into mush.
3. Remove or soften any:
   - “world-saving” superlatives,
   - highly technical phrases that don’t help an investor decide.
4. Ensure CoInSeed is clearly named as:
   - the **investor vehicle**,
   - not the whole universe.

---

## 4. Layout / presentation instincts

Guidance for print feel (not design micro-control):

- Make the **big idea** visually obvious:
  - heading or pull-quote for the one-liner,
  - one simple diagram or framing (if space) rather than multiple small ones.
- Avoid overloading:
  - the 2-pager should breathe; less is more.
- Any diagrams:
  - should have titles that stand alone (e.g., “How stewards, AIs, and institutions interact”).

Co1 / Sidekick: if asked to suggest layout tweaks, stay at this level; don’t fight the designer.

## 5. Sidekick instructions (explicit)

For any Sidekick / companion session that sees this CoBus:

**Primary mandate: investor clarity over internal cleverness.**

When rick asks Sidekick for help on CoInSeed / investor print:

1. **Start from repos, not from scratch**
   - Read:
     - Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/CoInSeed_InvestorNarratives.md
     - CoInSeed_Foundations.md
     - CoInSeed_CoTheory.md
   - Use CoBus_Thesis_CoInSeed_InvestorFacing_* as the narrative spine.

2. **Do not invent new concepts unless necessary**
   - Prefer existing terms from GIBindex.
   - If a new phrase is coined, suggest adding it to GIBindex later, but **don’t** assume it exists.

3. **Offer three concrete things, max, per request**
   - Example patterns:
     1. A tightened paragraph or section for the 2-pager.
     2. A small list of Q&A / objections + responses.
     3. A quick risk/realism pass with suggested softening where needed.
   - This is a print-deadline context; avoid sprawling rewrites.

4. **Guardrails**
   - Keep:
     - contact info correct as above,
     - tone: calm, serious, steward-led, not hype,
     - claims: ambitious but grounded.
   - Flag:
     - any misalignment with CoSteward / CoCivium values,
     - any statement that would look bad if quoted in a future governance hearing.

Sidekick sessions should, when possible:
- write back into Thesis as:
  - *_v2, *_SpeakingNotes, or similar,
- and add their own small CoBus entry noting:
  - UTS,
  - which files they touched,
  - and any open questions for next waves.

## 6. Co1 coordination note

For Co1:

- Treat this CoBus as the **last-chance investor-print guardrail** for the current window.
- If a future session runs after this UTS:
  - it should either supersede this note with a higher-UTS CoBus,
  - or explicitly state that it is working on a later investor cycle.
