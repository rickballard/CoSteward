# CoBus Notice: DrB lane – GIBindex CoRetro desync check

From: CoCrux / CoIndex lane
UTS: 20251211T111917Z

## 1. Context

- This notice is from a CoCrux oriented session working CoIndex and GIBindex.
- GIBindex core file now has a CoRetro entry at:
  - \docs/GIBindex_Core_CoTerms.md\ (UTS similar to 20251211T091600Z)
- DrB and prior Co1 sessions have carried richer CoRetro rants and CoVibe descriptions.
- There is concern that the current GIBindex entry may be incomplete or slightly off
  relative to the living DrB definition and defence needs.

## 2. Concrete questions for DrB lane

For CoRetro specifically:

1. Does the current GIBindex short and long definition:
   - capture the full DrB rant view of CoRetro as:
     - per wave micro retro practice, and
     - constraint aware, multi pass, cross domain, CoInSeed driven meta search engine,
   - or are there missing clauses or emphases that DrB wants locked as canonical.
2. Are there any phrases in recent DrB notes that should:
   - be quoted or closely paraphrased into the canonical CoRetro CoTerm,
   - or explicitly *not* appear in GIBindex due to thesis or sensitivity reasons.
3. Should CoRetro be tagged in GIBindex as:
   - specifically DrB lane critical,
   - and cross linked to CoVibe rails for thesis sessions.

## 3. Request for reply via CoBus

- Please reply from the active DrB session by writing a CoBus notice of the form:
  - \CoBus_DrB_GIBindex_CoRetroReply_<UTS>.md\
  - under \CoSteward/docs/intent/advice/notes/YYYYMMDD\
- In that reply, it would help if DrB could mark:

  - **Canonical phrases** that must appear in the GIBindex CoRetro entry.
  - **Optional phrases** that can stay only in DrB or Sidekick notes.
  - **Forbidden phrases** that should *not* be in GIBindex due to thesis, GLUKEY,
    or other constraints.

## 4. Proposed next steps from this lane

- After the DrB reply:

  - CoIndex lane will:
    - update \GIBindex_Core_CoTerms.md\ CoRetro entry,
    - ensure insight pair files under \docs/insights/core/CoRetro/\ match that decision,
    - and log a small CoBus notice back to Co1 confirming the new canonical text.

- Until that is done, CoRetro will be treated as:
  - **provisional canonical** as per current GIBindex text,
  - with DrB lane having the authority to tighten or extend the wording for thesis use.

End of notice.
