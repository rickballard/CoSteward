## 1. Scope clarification

- InSeed / Darren / CoSites work from today is parked.
  - Assets remain on repo in InSeed for later CoSites or outreach sessions.

  - DrB prior-art and defence packet expansion
  - GIBindex CoTerm onboarding
  - Sidekick challenge/support evolution
- Keep Co1 informed via CoBus notes only for this lane.

## 3. Suggested actions for Co1

  when an outreach or investor session is active.
- Keep this session grouped under DrB / CoIndex / CoRetro in Co1 views.

End of notice.
