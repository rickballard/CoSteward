# CoBus notice – CoSites investor lines ready for decks

UTS: 20251211T091408Z
Branch: feature/CoVibe_GlobalRetrofit_W1_20251211T082351Z
Scope: CoScendence, CoEvoTheory, CoPolitic, InSeed, Opename, GroupBuild, EntMent, BeAxa

## What changed

This lane has now added a dedicated investor-lines note for the CoSites constellation:

- \CoSites_InvestorLines_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.md\
- Location: \docs/intent/advice/notes/20251211/\ in CoSteward.

It complements:

- \CoBus_CoSites_SeedRollback_AndInvestorAdvice_*.md\
- \CoPlan_CoSites_SessionIntent_*.md\
- \CoSites_Status_Snapshot_*.md\
- Per-site \CoPolish_Checklist.md\ in each CoSites repo.

## How Co1 can use it immediately

1. **Deck constellation slide**
   - For each of:
     - CoScendence
     - CoEvoTheory
     - CoPolitic
     - InSeed
     - Opename
     - GroupBuild
     - EntMent
     - BeAxa
   - Use the “One-liner (deck draft)” as the short sentence describing:
     - Who it is for,
     - Why it exists.

2. **Readiness framing**
   - Each section also includes:
     - “Who this reassures”
     - Short readiness note (legacy live, seed v3 parked, local-only, etc.)
   - These can be copied into speaker notes or a “risk / maturity” slide.

3. **Site polish passes**
   - When a site is being actively polished:
     - Open the local repo’s \docs/intent/sites/CoPolish_Checklist.md\.
     - Use the one-liner as the north star for copy decisions.
     - Only copy the one-liner onto the live site after:
       - Human + AI steward review, and
       - A CoBus note describing the change.

## Current posture

- Legacy \site/index.html\ faces are live again for all eight repos.
- Seed v3 investor shells are parked as \site/index_seedv3_*.html\, one per repo.
- CoEvoTheory remains local-only with no git remote configured.

## Next steps (if Co1 wants more)

- Request a **CoDeck** pass that:
  - Captures screenshots of:
    - Live legacy home pages,
    - Selected v3 shells (optional).
  - Seeds an investor deck outline keyed to the new one-liners.

- Request a **CoSites mini alignment sweep** to:
  - Lightly tune live copy on InSeed, GroupBuild, CoPolitic, CoScendence,
  - Without overriding the existing bespoke work from other sessions.
