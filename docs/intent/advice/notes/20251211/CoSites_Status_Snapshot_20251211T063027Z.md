This file is intended for Co1 and other planning lanes as a quick view of:
- which CoSites repos exist locally,
- whether legacy indexes are live,
- whether seed v3 investor shells are parked and available.

Any future changes to live site indexes should be paired with a CoBus note and a small plan note if investor facing.
