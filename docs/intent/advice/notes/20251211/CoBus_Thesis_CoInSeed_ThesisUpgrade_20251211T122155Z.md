## Key assets

- Living thesis (upgraded draft, on feature branch / PR #4):
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/CoInSeed_Thesis.md`
- Latest snapshot (from upgrade wave):
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/snapshots/CoInSeed_Thesis_20251211T120508Z.md`
- CoRetro note (v1, in PR #3):
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/CoRetro_CoInSeed_Thesis_20251211T111847Z.md`
- Earlier snapshot (PR #2 vintage):
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/snapshots/CoInSeed_Thesis_20251211T101734Z.md`
- Changelog:
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/CoInSeed_Thesis_Changelog.md`

## PR state (at time of note)

- `Thesis#1` – bootstrap CoInSeed working draft – merged to `main`.
- `Thesis#2` – earlier snapshot PR – still pending / may need manual decision.
- `Thesis#3` – CoRetro note wiring – has merge conflict vs `main`.
- `Thesis#4` – CoInSeed thesis upgrade (CoSuite-stuffed) – open for review/merge.

## Intent of this wave

- Treat CoInSeed_Thesis.md as the stuffed, CoSuite-aligned strawman for Darren-facing work.
- Keep CoRetro discipline explicit via snapshots, changelog, and separate CoRetro notes.
- Give Co1 a clean pointer to the current best thesis draft (PR #4) while preserving history.

## Suggested next actions (future waves / Co1)

- Review and, if acceptable, merge PR #4 to make the upgraded thesis the mainline view.
- Resolve PR #3 against the upgraded thesis (or replace with a fresh CoRetro note PR on top of main).
- Decide whether PR #2 should be merged, closed, or superseded by newer snapshots.
- Derive audience-specific forks from the upgraded thesis:
  - 2-page investor summary for Darren and peers.
  - executive slide deck.
  - policy / academic whitepaper fork.
  - VR / gaming ecosystem fork (Civars, halos, CoAscendance).
