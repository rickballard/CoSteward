## Slide 1 – Title

- Title: “CoSites: Quiet-Phase Constellation”
- Subtitle: “Eight fronts for hybrid human–AI evolution”
- Visual:
  - Simple constellation diagram with:
    - CoScendence
    - CoEvoTheory
    - CoPolitic
    - InSeed
    - Opename
    - GroupBuild
    - EntMent
    - BeAxa

Speaker notes:
- This is not eight random brands.
- These are eight doors into the same thesis about hybrid society and edge-owned guardrails.

## Slide 2 – Why CoSites exists

- Bullet 1: The world is replatforming around AI; most sites still pretend it is 2015.
- Bullet 2: We need human-facing and AI-facing entry points that do not collapse people.
- Bullet 3: CoSites are experiments in how to talk about that honestly without overselling.

Speaker notes:
- Tie back to CoCivium and edge-owned guardrails.
- Emphasise quiet-phase discipline: deliberate low noise while foundations move.

- Table referencing CoSites_Status_Snapshot:
  - Columns: Site, Live index, Seed v3 parked, Special notes.
- Bullet:
  - “All sites currently in quiet-phase posture; small, coherent, but not ‘growth hacked’.”

Speaker notes:
- This is where you talk about discipline and risk management.
- Shows that you detect and repair cross-session collisions (rollback example).

---

## Slide 12 – Next 90 days

- Bullet 1: Light polish passes guided by CoPolish checklists.
- Bullet 2: Selective promotion of v3 patterns where stewards agree.
- Bullet 3: CoGbx facades and AI-facing views layered in gradually.

Speaker notes:
- Give investors a timeline that is measured and believable.
- Emphasise small, reversible steps rather than huge launches.

- Options:
  - 1–2 specific CoSites they can co-develop or pilot.
  - Support for CoSites as a bundled experiment in hybrid society on-ramps.
- Call to action:
  - “Pick one doorway where your network and CoSites are naturally aligned.”

Speaker notes:
- Turn the constellation into an invitation, not just a catalogue.
