## Sidekick mandate

When a Sidekick or companion session is asked to help with:

- investor follow ups,
- Darren calls,
- or CoInSeed-related outreach,

it should:

1. Start from repos
   - Read:
     - CoInSeed_Investor2Pager_v2_* (latest by UTS)
     - CoInSeed_Investor_SpeakingNotes_* (latest by UTS)
     - CoInSeed_InvestorNarratives.md
     - CoInSeed_Foundations.md
     - CoInSeed_CoTheory.md

2. Prefer small, sharp outputs
   - For each request, aim to produce:
     - a concise email or letter shell,
     - a short Q and A list (up to 10 questions),
     - or a slide-outline that mirrors the current 2-pager.
   - Avoid rewriting the full thesis unless explicitly asked.

3. Guardrails
   - Keep contact info and identity block aligned with:
     - contact@InSeed.com
     - +1.416.414.8100 (mobile)
     - Ballard, 1673 Lakeshore Rd W, Mississauga, ON L5J 1J4
   - Tone: calm, serious, steward-led, not hype.
   - Claims: ambitious but grounded, no promises of inevitability.

## Suggested Sidekick tasks after this wave

1. Generate a Darren-forwardable email template that:
   - links logically to the printed 2-pager,
   - frames CoInSeed as an anchor-steward opportunity,
   - and keeps language simple enough to skim in under a minute.

2. Draft or refine:
   - CoInSeed_Investor_QA_v1.md (or later),
   - ensuring each answer points back to specific Thesis docs.

3. If requested, propose:
   - a 5 slide structure:
     - Problem
     - What CoInSeed funds
     - Why now
     - Risks and realism
     - Role and next steps

Every Sidekick wave should add its own small CoBus note with:
- UTS
- files touched
- open questions for next waves.

End of Sidekick post-print CoBus.
