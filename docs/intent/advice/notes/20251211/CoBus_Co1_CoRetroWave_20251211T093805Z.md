UTS: 20251211T093805Z

## 1. What changed this wave

- CoIndex branch \eature/CoRetro_20251211T090300Z\ now carries:
  - CoRetro insight pair:
    - \docs/insights/core/CoRetro/CoRetro_Theory_20251211T084052Z.md\
    - \docs/insights/core/CoRetro/CoRetro_Practice_20251211T084052Z.md\
  - Sidekick challenge/support files:
    - \docs/drb/Sidekick_ChallengeSupport_20251211T080340Z.md\
    - \docs/drb/Sidekick_ChallengeSupport_20251211T081307Z.md\
  - CoRetro block added to GIBindex core:
    - \docs/GIBindex_Core_CoTerms.md\

- CoRetro is now defined as:
  - a per-wave micro-retro practice, and
  - a constraint-aware, diversity-seeking meta-search schema for CoCivium.

## 2. Current status and intent

- Status:
  - Branch pushed: \eature/CoRetro_20251211T090300Z\ (ready for PR / review).
  - No changes yet merged to \main\ for CoIndex.
- Intent:
  - Use CoRetro as default method for:
    - DrB thesis prior-art sweeps and challenge/support expansion,
    - GIBindex term evolution,
    - Sidekick defence-packet enrichment.

## 3. Suggested actions for Co1

- Review and (if aligned) approve merge of:
  - \eature/CoRetro_20251211T090300Z\ into \main\ in CoIndex.
- Treat CoRetro as:
  - the standard search/retro protocol for:
    - Co-Theory of Civilization,
    - Sidekick challenge packets,
    - future CoTerm onboarding into GIBindex.

## 4. Next planned steps from this session

- Extend Sidekick with more challenge/defence packets for DrB.
- Add further CoTerms (for example CoEvoLoop, CoInSeed, CoRetroEveryWave) into
  \GIBindex_Core_CoTerms.md\ via similar DO rails.
- Keep Co1 updated each wave via CoBus notes like this one.

End of notice.
