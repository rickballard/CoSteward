## Current status (short snapshot)

- Investor 2-pager exists and is under PR.
- CoInSeed thesis spine is now structured in dedicated CoInSeed docs.
- CoTsunami is defined in GIBindex as the pattern for these large, safe waves.
- CoBus note exists to guide investor-facing language and Sidekick behavior.

## Near-term intent (hours–days)

- Stabilize and, if possible, merge:
  - Thesis#6 (2-pager) once language feels Darren-safe.
  - Thesis#7 (tsunami docs) once structure and filenames feel right.
- Derive from CoBus_Thesis_CoInSeed_InvestorFacing:
  - a one-page speaking-notes doc in Thesis,
  - a Darren-facing email draft for forwarding to first candidate investor.
- Keep all new investor-facing artifacts wired back to:
  - Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/*,
  - relevant CoBus notes in CoSteward.

## Mid-term intent (days–weeks)

- Use CoInSeed docs as the canonical feedstock for:
  - slide decks and meeting packs,
  - CoRoadmaps and CoIndex links,
  - sponsor / steward onboarding materials.
- Run scheduled CoRetro passes to:
  - tighten academic framing,
  - align terminology with GIBindex,
  - cross-link to CoTheoryTree / CoRoots diagrams.
- Prove the CoTsunami pattern as a repeatable way to:
  - push large, safe waves through,
  - keep everything PR-contained and reversible.

## Long-term intent (months–years)

- Position CoInSeed as the primary investor vehicle for:
  - CoCivium / CoSuite infrastructure,
  - edge-owned guardrails,
  - and CoSteward-led governance experiments.
- Let Thesis + GIBindex co-evolve into:
  - the formal CoInSeed thesis,
  - a reusable playbook for steward-led AI governance deals.
- Treat CoTsunami as a standard pattern for:
  - multi-repo evolution bursts,
  - coordinated sponsor / investor waves,
  - and future Co1-led orchestration cycles across the CoSuite.

## Co1 action hints

- Track Thesis#6, Thesis#7, and the CoTsunami GIBindex branch as the active CoInSeed front.
- When new sessions ask about investors, sponsors, or CoInSeed:
  - default to these CoBus notes and CoInSeed docs as the source of truth,
  - prefer repo-first evolution (PRs + CoBus) over prose-only advice.
