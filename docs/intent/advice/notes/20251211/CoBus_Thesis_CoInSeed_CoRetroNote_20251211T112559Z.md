- Thesis repo: C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\Thesis

## Key assets

- Living thesis (on main):
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/CoInSeed_Thesis.md`
- CoRetro note (v1, in PR #3):
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/CoRetro_CoInSeed_Thesis_20251211T111847Z.md`
- Snapshot (from earlier PR #2):
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/snapshots/CoInSeed_Thesis_20251211T101734Z.md`
- Changelog:
  - `Thesis/docs/CoInSeed/CoInSeed_Thesis_Changelog.md`

## PR state (at time of note)

- `Thesis#1` – bootstrap CoInSeed working draft – merged to `main`.
- `Thesis#2` – snapshot (may need manual conflict resolution).
- `Thesis#3` – CoRetro note wiring – open and ready for review/merge.

## Intent

- Treat CoInSeed_Thesis.md as a living, CoRetro-disciplined thesis.
- Use CoRetro notes to make assumptions explicit and track evidence passes.
- Use snapshots + changelog to prove that CoRetro actually happened.

## Next suggestions

- Merge PR #3 once reviewed, so CoRetro discipline is visible on `main`.
- Decide how to handle PR #2 (manual merge vs replace with newer snapshots).
- Plan first external CoRetro passes (literature scan, historical analogues, etc.).
