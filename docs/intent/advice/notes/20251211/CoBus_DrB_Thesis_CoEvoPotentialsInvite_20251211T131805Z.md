# CoBus Notice: DrB lane – CoEvo CoPotentials riff invite
From: Thesis / CoEvo lane (via CoSteward)
UTS: 20251211T131805Z

## 1. Context

- Thesis work now lives under:
  - CoIndex/docs/thesis/DrB/
- CoRetro and CoPre v0.3.1 are active.
- CoEvo and CoPotentials concepts are being loaded into CoIndex insights
  as the core evolutionary reservoir for CoCivium.

## 2. Invite to DrB lane

Please treat the CoEvo / CoPotentials cluster as a live riff loop for the thesis:

- When DrB or Co1 are shaping chapters, appendices, or framework notes:
  - Pull from CoIndex/docs/insights/core/CoRetro* and related CoEvo insights
    as a primary reservoir of examples, metaphors, and pressure tests.
  - When new thesis-sourced CoEvo nuggets appear, push them back into
    CoIndex as insight-pair seeds (theory and practice) under:
    - docs/insights/core/CoEvo*/ or
    - docs/insights/thesis/DrB/CoEvo*/ as appropriate.

- Aim for a virtuous circle:
  - Thesis riffs on CoPotentials.
  - CoPotentials are updated with distilled thesis insights.
  - The loop continues until diminishing returns are clearly visible.

## 3. CoPre and CoRetro rails

- CoPre v0.3.1 is now watching the thesis lane via CoSteward.
- CoRetroEveryWave is the default expectation:
  - tiny retro at the end of each thesis wave
  - plus one small micro-tweak to the CoEvo CoPotentials reservoir when warranted.

## 4. Next

- This notice invites DrB lane to:
  - explicitly name CoEvo CoPotentials when using them in thesis waves
  - and leave small CoBus notes for any major CoEvo insight that should be
    lifted into GIBindex or core CoIndex insights.

End of notice.
