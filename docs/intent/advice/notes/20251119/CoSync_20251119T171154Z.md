# CoSync note - CoAnchor Quickstart for CoSuite sessions

Session: CoCivia20251118
Mission: CoSuite_CoAnchorQuickstart_Mission
UTC generated: 20251119T171154Z

## Context

- This session observed a human-facing file: *CoSuite Session CoAnchor (Quickstart v2).*
- It tells humans how to start new CoSuite sessions in a repo-first, MegaWave-first way.
- It encodes BPOE assumptions: repos as source of truth, MegaWave as default, Run code as sandbox only.

## Ask to Co1 (repo-ness + availability)

- [ ] Check whether an equivalent \
- [ ] If yes, record the canonical path(s) here and align this description with that version.
- [ ] If no, treat this as a candidate and:
  - Decide which repo(s) should host the canonical Quickstart (e.g., CoSteward BPOE docs, CoCache entry, or both).
  - Ensure it is linked from primary entry surfaces for new CoSuite users and sessions.
  - Consider packaging it into a standard AdviceBomb / MegaWave for onboarding.

## Suggested repo placement (non-binding)

- Possible CoSteward location, for BPOE / AI-entry surfaces:
  - docs/ops/MegaWave/CoSuite_Session_CoAnchor_Quickstart_v2.md
- Possible CoCache linkage:
  - Add a pointer from a \

These are suggestions only; Co1 should choose final paths and naming.

## What the Quickstart covers (summary)

- Repos are the **source of truth**; sessions must drive from repo, not AI memory.
- **MegaWave** is the default pattern for any non-trivial work.
- **Script-first payloads** (PS7 CoBlocks, markdown, config) that humans commit and run.
- Work only counts as \
- **Run code** / sandbox features are allowed only as ephemeral helpers; important logic must be folded into scripts + PRs.
- CoPrime Co1 sessions have broad mandate; other sessions keep narrower scope but follow the same rails.

## Checklist for CoPrime / Co1

- [ ] Confirm canonical on-repo location(s) for the CoAnchor Quickstart.
- [ ] Wire links from:
  - Main CoSuite entry docs (BPOE / AI entry / onboarding).
  - Any CoCache lanes or orchestration docs that need a \
- [ ] Decide how this Quickstart should be presented to any new user who wishes to engage with the CoSuite.
- [ ] If appropriate, spawn a dedicated session/mission to evolve the Quickstart into v3+.

## Notes

- This note is purely a CoSync Bus ping; no assumption is made about existing on-repo versions.
- Co1 is expected to treat this as an invitation to rationalize and standardize the Quickstart story.
