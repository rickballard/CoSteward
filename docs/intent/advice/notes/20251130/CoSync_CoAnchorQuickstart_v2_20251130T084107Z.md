repos_touched : CoSteward, CoCache

## What changed

- Desktop grenade refreshed:
  - Desktop/CoAnchor_Quickstart_Generic_v2.md
- Canonical onramp added/updated:
  - CoSteward/docs/onramps/CoAnchor_Quickstart_Generic_v2.md
- Product card seeded:
  - CoCache/docs/products/CoAnchor_Quickstart_ProductCard_v1.md

## Intent

- Provide a generic-first, Q&A-up-front quickstart any user can paste into
  a new AI session, even if they know nothing about CoSuite / CoBus / Co1.
- Keep advanced rails (repos, CoBus, CoSuite/Co1) in clearly marked
  optional sections, so generic users are never blocked or confused.
- Make it easy for CoSteward/CoCache to publish CoAnchor as a "free to
  world" helper, alongside other products.

## Next waves (suggested)

- Wire CoAnchor into public-facing docs/sites as a downloadable markdown.
- Add GIBindex entries for "CoAnchor" and related patterns once CoIndex
  lanes are ready.
- If CoStatus tracks helper products, add a small CoStatus pulse for
  CoAnchor Quickstart v2.
