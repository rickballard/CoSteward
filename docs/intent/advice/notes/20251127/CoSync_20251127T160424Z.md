# CoSync note – CoSync bus evolution + CoSteward rails

- Mission Id   : CoSync_Bus_Evolution_Mission
- Session Label: CoSteward20251121
- Source       : Benedict / InSeed-CoSteward rail work
- Repo root    : C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\CoSteward

## 1. New / updated rails

- docs/concepts/CoSteward.RoleDefinition.md
- GIBindex/entries/CoSteward_and_HybridSociety.md
- docs/protocols/CoSync_Bus_Evolution_Recommendations_v1.md

Supporting anchors:

- InSeed:
  - docs/whitepapers/CoSteward_HybridSociety_WhitePaper_v1.md
  - docs/whitepapers/CoSteward_DinosaurDeck_Blurb_v1.md
  - docs/slides/InSeed_ExecTraining_StewardDeck_DinosaurEdition_v1.pptx
- CoSteward:
  - docs/waves/CoSteward20251121/MW_CoSteward_Rails_Fill_v1_*.md
  - docs/waves/CoSteward20251121/MW_CoSyncBus_Evolution_Recommendations_Install_v1_*.md

## 2. Request: CoSteward README front door

Current state:
- README.md on main shows the "CoPrime Handoff — Co1 → Co1b" bundle.

Suggestion for Co1 / CoAnchor lane:

1. Move detailed handoff instructions into a dedicated doc, e.g.:
   - docs/handoff/CoPrime_Co1_to_Co1b_v1.md
   - or extend COPRIME_BREADCRUMB.md

2. Replace README.md with a calm, pre-dashboards front door that:

   - Points acting stewards to:
     - CoSync_Plan.md
     - Intent_Checklist.md

   - Links to the new rails:
     - docs/concepts/CoSteward.RoleDefinition.md
     - GIBindex/entries/CoSteward_and_HybridSociety.md

3. Treat README as the home page for CoStewards; keep handoff bundles under docs/handoff/.

Goal:
- README = simple orientation + links; CoPrime handoff docs = deeper ops detail.

## 3. Request: CoSync bus evolution checklist

Document:
- docs/protocols/CoSync_Bus_Evolution_Recommendations_v1.md

Requests to Co1:

1. Ingest this doc and map items into lanes and missions under:
   - MissionId: CoSync_Bus_Evolution_Mission

2. Over time, use the CoSync bus to:

   - Detect multi-session scope overlaps / CoCreep / CoDrift.
   - Nudge active sessions when work should be re-scoped or handed off.
   - Prefer advisory routing over duplicated effort across sessions and repos.

3. Capture and evolve CoTips mentioned in the recommendations (and in this session) into:

   - CoSteward Operations Manual (session blank timeouts, CoRabbit, etc.).
   - GIBindex entries for:
     - CoRabbit, CoCreep, CoDrift, CoLucidity, and contributor-behaviour tips.
   - A CoCivium insight pair:
     - "CoSync Bus" (theory) and "CoSync Bus" (practice).

## 5. CoPing

- CU = OK
- PU = SOFT (multiple rails touched; MW cycles ~60m)
- HU = SOFT
- WT = OK

Intent:
- Make it easy for Co1 to:
  - See new rails and anchors.
  - Decide how to fold README, CoSync bus evolution, and CoCivium insight work into existing lanes.
