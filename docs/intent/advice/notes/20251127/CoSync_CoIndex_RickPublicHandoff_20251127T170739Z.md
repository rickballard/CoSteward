# CoSync – CoIndex → RickPublic outreach handoff v1

Stamp   : 20251127T170739Z

Targets : "RickPublic outreach plans" session, Co1, CoPortal+Git

## Context

- CoIndex is now the design-prime-time semantic backbone for CoCivium and CoSuite.
- Co1 is building a ProtoCoIndex to expose highlighted assets to AIs.
- This session framed CoIndex as a key engine for **post-natural evolution** and
  civic-safe **CoEvolution** of meaning (see CoIndex/README.md).

RickPublic will eventually need to carry the public narrative and brand stakes
around these ideas.

## Request to RickPublic outreach plans

Please stage a RickPublic wave (article + follow-ons) around:

1. **Re-indexing the AI training corpus**
   - Working title (suggested):
     - "Re-indexing the AI training corpus: why CoCivium needs a semantic backbone"
   - Core themes:
     - training corpora as civic infrastructure, not just model fuel,
     - why naive "more data" fails democracy,
     - how CoIndex-style semantics (canonality, reputation, constraints)
       could be applied at corpus level,
     - the role of Edge-owned guardrails vs platform-owned indexes.

2. **Concept land-grab for CoCivium**
   - Stamp CoCivium / CoIndex as originators (or early stewards) of:
     - CoIndex (semantic backbone for hybrid society),
     - CoPointees and C–I–X–S–K tuples,
     - civic-safe reputation overlays (MeritRank, RepTag, digital halos),
     - ProtoCoIndex vs full CoIndex pattern (skinny bridge vs full-fat spine),
     - CoPortals / CoBeacons as AI-facing vs human-facing surfaces for semantics.

3. **Launch bundle concept**
   - Consider a small suite of coordinated pieces (RickPublic + CoCivium.org):
     - main essay (corpus re-indexing),
     - shorter concept briefs (CoIndex, ProtoCoIndex, CoPortals),
     - a visual explainer (CoTree/CoRoots/semantic backbone for hybrid society),
     - an "invitation to stewards" CTA (how other orgs can plug into CoIndex).

## Guardrails and expectations

- Treat CoIndex repo as **infra canon**:
  - do not contradict its semantics; propose improvements via PRs / CoSync notes.
- Position ProtoCoIndex clearly as a transitional helper, not the end-state.
- Keep the narrative aligned with:
  - Edge-owned governance,
  - transparent drift,
  - no single-vendor capture.

Once RickPublic has capacity, a dedicated session can run a MegaWave for this bundle.
This note is just a handoff marker so that this CoIndex session can close scope cleanly.
