# CoSync – Standards Wave 1 (Meta-schemas)

- Session: Standards20251126
- Wave: Wave 1 – AI-Native Standards Meta-Schemas
- Repos:
  - CoIndex

## What was done

- Replaced initial stub schemas with structured meta-schemas:
  - schemas/CoEnvelope.schema.json
  - schemas/CoMetaRail.schema.json
  - schemas/CoSpecLoop.schema.json
- Left .toon variants as future mirrors of the JSON definitions.
- PR merged:
  - https://github.com/rickballard/CoIndex/pull/2

## Intent

- Establish a reusable, standard-agnostic meta-framework:
  - CoEnvelope (StandardEnvelope) for wrapping any standard.
  - CoMetaRail (GovernanceProfile) for describing governance rails.
  - CoSpecLoop (EvolutionProfile) for evolution loops and telemetry.
- These schemas are the backbone for AI-native, self-evolving standards.

## Next steps

- Wave 2:
  - Apply the meta-framework to TOON internally by creating:
    - TOON_StandardEnvelope.toon
    - TOON_GovernanceProfile.toon
    - TOON_EvolutionProfile.toon
  - Start drafting TOON AI-Portal examples that use these envelopes/profiles.
