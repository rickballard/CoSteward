This note records the current CoIndex position:

- CoIndex is the **semantic backbone design** for CoCivium and the CoSuite.
- C I X S K object model, CoPointees, canonality, reputation, governance, evolution pipeline,
  export schema, StandardsTag spec, and a working example export are in place.
- CoIndex is *design-prime-time* but not yet the fully operational infra index.

Co1 / CoPortal+Git / CoSteward / CoCivia / Standards sessions should:

- Route all new indexing design work via CoIndex.
- Use CoIndex exports for small pilots where safe.
- Defer full "CoIndex runs everything" flipover until helpers, night jobs, migration,
  and downstream wiring are implemented in future waves.
