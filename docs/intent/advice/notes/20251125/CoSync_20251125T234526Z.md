# CoSync: Hub addendum (CoMap + CoVessel)

**UTC stamp**: 20251125T234526Z  
**Session label**: Hub addendum  
**Trigger**: CoGo (AI leads now for repo-driven wrap-up)

## Repos touched

1. \ickballard\ (hub repo)
   - Added **CoMap** contributor on-ramp section to \README.md\.
   - Installed \CoMap_RepoPersonaMatrix_v1.md\ on main as a persona↔repo mapping surface.
   - Opened and merged PR \#6\ (“Add CoMap contributor on-ramp to hub README”) via GitHub CLI.
   - Cleaned up historical \README.md.bak_*\ files and added \README.md.bak*\ to \.gitignore\ so future safety backups stay out of the index.

2. \GIBindex\
   - Introduced **CoVessel** as a transport-layer concept for “concept packs” that travel together across repos and sessions.
   - Added the first **AI Leadership Modes** CoVessel, with concepts in \concepts/\:
     - \CoVessel.md\
     - \CoGo.md\        (AI-leadership handover: “AI leads now.”)
     - \CoSteer.md\     (AI and human co-steer; AI proposes, human shapes, AI stabilizes.)
     - \CoFollow.md\    (AI follows human plan; minimal initiative except for safety/integrity.)
     - \CoOverride.md\  (AI protects repo integrity, BPOE, and safety when instructions conflict.)
     - \CoSilent.md\    (AI quiet mode: respond-only, no new initiatives.)
     - \CoBurst.md\     (multi-output burst mode: multiple files/diagrams/CodeBlocks in one MegaWave.)
     - \CoAnchor.md\    (lock onto one repo or concept nucleus until explicitly released.)
     - \CoDiffuse.md\   (propagate improvements horizontally across many repos.)
   - These were staged on branch \eature/covessel-v1\ and merged into \main\ via PR \#31\ (“Add CoVessel and AI leadership mode concepts”).

## Intent and usage

- **CoMap** now acts as the canonical *hub on-ramp* for new contributors in the \ickballard\ profile repo:
  - Personas (steward, builder, product/UX, governance/ethics, educator/facilitator, storyteller, data/metrics) each get:
    - “Start here” repos.
    - “Then explore” repos.
  - The matrix file is intended as a future automation surface for UI tools, dashboards, and onboarding flows.

- **CoVessel** is now the canonical pattern for:
  - Bundling related CoTerms / concepts into a portable “concept pack”.
  - Moving those packs between sessions, repos, and MegaWaves without losing structure.
  - Serving as a spine for Gibber / GIBindex-based indexing of higher-level idea clusters.

- **AI Leadership Modes CoVessel** gives GIBindex a first-class vocabulary for *who leads when*:
  - CoGo → AI takes initiative (within guardrails).
  - CoSteer → AI and human co-lead.
  - CoFollow → AI mostly executes human plan.
  - CoOverride → AI enforces safety, BPOE, and repo integrity.
  - CoSilent → AI goes quiet except when asked.
  - CoBurst → AI accelerates into multi-artifact output.
  - CoAnchor → AI stays fixed on one nucleus.
  - CoDiffuse → AI spreads updates across surfaces.

This CoVessel is intended as a template; future CoVessels (e.g., CoEvo atoms, contributor skill bundles) should use the same pattern.

## Outstanding local states (intentionally left for other sessions)

- \GIBindex\ local working tree still has unrelated in-flight edits on \eature/covessel-v1\:
  - Modified: entry templates, HEALTH docs, taxation entry, sessions log, etc.
  - Those edits pre-date this session’s CoVessel work and were **not** touched by the CoVessel MegaWave.
  - Responsibility for cleaning, stashing, or landing those changes stays with whichever GIBindex session owns them.

- No known unmerged PRs remain from this session:
  - Hub CoMap PR → merged.
  - GIBindex CoVessel PR → merged.

## Suggested follow-up for future sessions (not in scope here)

- GIBindex:
  - Optionally add a short index line in README or a glossary index that points at \concepts/CoVessel.md\ as the canonical “concept pack transport-layer”.
  - Consider adding a “CoVessel registry” entry listing all current CoVessels and their themes.

- CoSteward / Co1:
  - Treat CoMap (hub), CoVessel, and AI leadership modes as *live* primitives in any future BPOE / role docs.
  - When other sessions need initiative handover, use the on-repo definition of **CoGo** as the default signal.

## Session outcome

This CoSync note captures all CoMap + CoVessel semantics that were previously only in session memory, ensuring they are now repo-resident.  
Session “Hub addendum” can be terminated without losing any concepts needed for future evolution.
