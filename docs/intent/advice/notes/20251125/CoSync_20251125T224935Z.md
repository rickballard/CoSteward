# CoSync – Standards Wave 0 (Schemas stubs)

- Session: Standards20251126
- Wave: Wave 0 – AI-Native Standards Meta-Framework (schema stubs)
- Repos:
  - CoIndex

## What was done

- Created initial schema stub files in CoIndex:
  - schemas/CoEnvelope.schema.json
  - schemas/CoEnvelope.schema.toon
  - schemas/CoMetaRail.schema.json
  - schemas/CoMetaRail.schema.toon
  - schemas/CoSpecLoop.schema.json
  - schemas/CoSpecLoop.schema.toon
- Opened and merged PR:
  - https://github.com/rickballard/CoIndex/pull/1

## Intent

- Establish placeholder schemas for:
  - CoEnvelope (StandardEnvelope)
  - CoMetaRail (GovernanceProfile)
  - CoSpecLoop (EvolutionProfile)
- These stubs will be evolved in Wave 1+ into a reusable meta-framework for AI-native, self-evolving standards.

## Next steps

- Wave 1:
  - Design actual JSON/TOON schemas for CoEnvelope/CoMetaRail/CoSpecLoop.
  - Apply them to TOON internally:
    - TOON_StandardEnvelope.toon
    - TOON_GovernanceProfile.toon
    - TOON_EvolutionProfile.toon
- Prepare CoPortal-oriented TOON examples for later upstream PR.
