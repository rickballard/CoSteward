# CoSync note — CoBadLand fallback BPOE mini-wave (snapshot)

- Session label: CoBadLandFallback
- Local date : 2025-11-25
- UTC stamp  : 20251125T234356Z

## Waves

- MW1: CoBadLand fallback BPOE note created and pushed on branch \$branch\.
- MW2: PR opened for CoBadLand fallback BPOE note in \CoSteward\ (see repo for PR id).

## Pointers

- BPOE doc : \$coBadLandDoc\
- Branch   : \$branch\

## Notes

- CoBadLand = environments where download links for MegaWave artifacts are unreliable
  (expired links, 404s, sandbox resets) but PS7 + repos still behave.
- In CoBadLand, MegaWave is considered valid if:
  - a paste-safe CoBlock can recreate all artifacts,
  - a wave manifest exists (notes + pointers),
  - branch + PR are clearly identified for repo landing.

This CoSync note lets Co1 / HP treat CoBadLand as a first-class BPOE mode
instead of an ad-hoc workaround.
