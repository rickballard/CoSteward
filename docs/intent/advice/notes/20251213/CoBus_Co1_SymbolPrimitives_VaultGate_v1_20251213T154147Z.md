# CoBus: CoGibber Symbolic Primitives (Vault gate) (20251213T154147Z)

## Ask
- Please ingest the attached symbol advisory into Co1's CoGibber lexicon workstream.
- Goal: expand portable symbolic primitives, one CoTerm per symbol, with multidimensional schema + linkages.

## Safety gate (default)
- Treat the symbol→meaning compression mapping as potentially IP-bearing.
- Default classification: **VaultOnly** until explicitly proven RepoSafe.
- If any part touches GLUKEY/HP57, keep it in vault and only publish a pointer/receipt.

## Deliverables requested from Co1
- A tiered symbol deck (Tier A/B/C portability).
- CoTerms + CoMetaCloud linkages per symbol.
- A short CoPre-friendly subset (tiny header payload) derived from the deck.

## Input source
- File: Co1_Advisory_CoGibber_Symbolic_Primitives.md (this session upload)
- Also consider CoAnchor Quickstart/BPOE rails for repo-first enforcement.

## Definition of done
- Vault receipt exists (path + hash) OR repo merge evidence exists (PR merged to main).
- CoBus note back to CoSteward with pointers.
