# CoSync — guard gating landed (20251106_044942Z)

**Repo:** rickballard/CoSteward

**Merged**
- Event-gated guard: PR = **hard-fail**; workflow_dispatch = **warn-only** (sticky report intact).

**Validated**
- Manual dispatch on \	est/guard-v2-selfcheck\ runs and logs retrievable.

**Next**
- Keep warn-mode toggle branch around during heavy refactors; re-enable strict PR enforcement as baseline.
