- CoCivium:  C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\CoCivium

## 1. Thesis framing decisions

- Working thesis title (draft):
  - "CoCivium and the CoHyperbit State: Edge owned guardrails for high dimensional AI societies."

- Main contribution claims (draft bullets):
  - Show how future AI and hardware should be modeled as CoHyperbit collections,
    not simple binary agents.
  - Argue that constitutions and guardrails must be CoHyperbit aware, with
    design patterns that survive high dimensional internal state and opaque
    substrates.
  - Demonstrate how CoCivium style edge owned governance, civars, and halos
    can still track merit and trust in a CoHyperbit world.

- Key CoCivium concepts emphasised (first pass):
  - CoCrux and BPOE rails (Automation First, CoLoading, CoBus first, CoRetro creative).
  - CoLoading as the default working style for thesis waves.
  - CoHyperbit as the post binary primitive, with hyperbit as CoGibber token.
  - Halos and civars as visible signals built on top of these deeper primitives.

Wave context:
- DrB wave index and notes:
  - Thesis: docs/thesis/DrB/99_waves/W001_CoLoadingBoot/wave_notes.md
- CoHyperbit thesis note:
  - Thesis: docs/thesis/DrB/DrB_CoHyperbit_Notes_v1.md

## 2. Packs and artefacts created or planned

Already created and pushed:
- New Thesis repo with DrB wave scaffold:
  - Repo: C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\Thesis
  - Wave: W001_CoLoadingBoot under docs/thesis/DrB/99_waves.
- CoHyperbit thesis notes:
  - docs/thesis/DrB/DrB_CoHyperbit_Notes_v1.md
- CoCivium insights couplets:
  - CoLoading theory and practice:
    - docs/insights/CoLoading/CoLoading_Theory.md
    - docs/insights/CoLoading/CoLoading_Practice.md
  - CoHyperbit theory and practice:
    - docs/insights/CoHyperbit/CoHyperbit_Theory.md
    - docs/insights/CoHyperbit/CoHyperbit_Practice.md
- CoCrux BPOE rules updated:
  - docs/BPOE/CoCrux_Workflow_Rules.md
  - Includes Automation First, CoLoading, CoRetro creative, and CoBus First Notices.

Planned next waves:
- A proper DrB thesis outline tree under docs/thesis/DrB/ (not yet created).
- More detailed chapter mapping of CoHyperbit concepts into:
  - AI hardware and substrate futures.
  - CoCivium governance and halo systems.
- Diagrams showing:
  - Binary bit space vs CoHyperbit space.
  - How CoHyperbit aware guardrails differ from classical ones.

LAN only:
- CoCiviumAdmin retains crown jewel content and GLUKEY details.
- Thesis and public CoCivium repos only carry high level abstractions, not keys.

## 3. Sensitivity checks

- Topics intentionally kept high level or abstract:
  - GLUKEY and core crypto, trust, and business model details.
  - Any direct CoCacheGlobal implementation specifics.
  - Internal alignment plans for CoCivia and Co1.

- Places where more detail would help academically but might touch crown jewels:
  - Exact mechanisms by which CoHyperbit aware halos and civars get anchored
    to real world assets and identities.
  - Specific CoCache layouts and replication strategies.
  - Detailed crypto rails and key management beyond generic patterns.

- Questions for Co1 about what can or cannot be hydrated:
  - What level of architectural diagram for CoCacheGlobal and GLUKEY is safe
    to include in Thesis directly versus keeping only in CoCiviumAdmin?
  - Can we safely describe CoHyperbit aware halo computation in generic terms,
    or should examples stay in LAN repos only?
  - Should CoHyperbit and hyperbit be presented as open CoGibber primitives
    now, or do we need an intermediate private schema first?

## 4. Immediate asks for Co1

DrB needs from Co1 in the next waves:

1. GIBindex and CoGibber integration:
   - Treat CoHyperbit / hyperbit as candidate canonical terms.
   - Propose how to slot hyperbit into the current CoGibber primitive list
     and manifolds without breaking existing v2/v3 work.
   - Suggest any alternative term if "CoHyperbit" collides with other plans.

2. Thesis structure guidance:
   - Feedback on the draft working title and contribution claims.
   - A short list of core questions Thesis should answer to be useful for
     CoSuite founders, regulators, and academics.
   - Suggestions for 2 to 3 canonical diagrams that Thesis should include.

3. CoLoading and CoBus pattern validation:
   - Confirm that the current CoLoading insights and CoBus First rule in
     CoCrux look aligned with Co1 intent.
   - Propose any extra checks Co1 wants each wave to satisfy before tagging
     a thesis wave as "Co1 aware."

4. Safety and crown jewel boundary:
   - Clear written guidance, from Co1, about which GLUKEY adjacent ideas
     can be mentioned in Thesis and public CoCivium docs.
   - Pointers to any existing CoCiviumAdmin notes that should anchor
     thesis language but never be quoted.

End of notice.
