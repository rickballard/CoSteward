# CoBus Notice to Co1: CoCrux + CoEvoMetaHandles + Darren Pack (v0.1)

(Use this as paste text into Co1 if needed. Summary only; sensitive details should stay in local vaults.)

## 1. Repo updates

- New CoCrux and CoEvo MetaHandles insights landed in CoCivium:
  - Branch: feature/CoCrux_CoEvoMetaHandles_v0_1_20251210T183732Z
  - See docs/insights/CoCrux and docs/insights/CoEvoMetaHandles.

## 2. Darren pack alignment

- CoCrux and CoEvo MetaHandles are now the preferred naming frame for the Thursday investor advisory session with Darren.
- Presentation should look academic and civic tech focused.
- Deeper business roadmap remains implicit, with RickPublic root README as the only mildly explicit big picture.

## 3. Soft Launch and VR halo story

- Strategy:
  - Soft Launch via academically framed work.
  - Target VR gaming and social communities as substrate users.
  - Provide easy add halos and civar overlays from CoCivium verified sources of truth.
- These details should be written cautiously on public repos and kept explicit only in controlled contexts such as CoCiviumAdmin.

## 4. Exposure and mitigation

- Co1 remains the lead for:
  - Detecting over exposure of crown jewels on public repos.
  - Requesting retro cleanups and mitigation.
- Other sessions should:
  - Treat repos as source of truth.
  - Avoid spelling out GLUKEY or full business plan language on GitHub.
  - Route detailed roadmaps and investor sensitive content to LAN vaults.

## 5. CoCloud aggregation

- Co1 should keep aggregating CoClouds and concept clusters for:
  - CoCrux, CC, CoGibberCC.
  - CoPre, CoParallelity.
  - CoPotential, CoBloat, CoTrust, CoAwe, CoMegaTrain.
  - VR halos and civar signalling story.

This note is a CoBus pointer only and should be interpreted together with the CoCrux and CoEvo MetaHandles insights in CoCivium.
