# CoBus Notice: Co1 – DrB Thesis W001 CoLoadingBoot + CoOmnibit seed

From: DrB  
UTS: 20251211T010204Z

## 1. Thesis framing updates

- Working wave: **W001_CoLoadingBoot** in rickballard/Thesis
  - Scaffolded via tools/DO_Thesis_DrB_NewWave_v2.ps1
  - Wave notes, AI log, and TODO seeded.
- New concept emphasised: **CoOmnibit**
  - Omni-dimensional generalisation of bit/qubit, used as a future-compute
    primitive in DrB narrative.
  - First definition lives in:
    - Thesis: docs/thesis/DrB/01_frontmatter/DrB_Glossary_CoTerms.md
    - CoCivium: docs/insights/CoOmnibit/CoOmnibit_Theory.md
                docs/insights/CoOmnibit/CoOmnibit_Practice.md

## 2. Packs and artefacts

- Thesis repo:
  - Wave W001 scaffold and glossary seeded on main.
- CoCivium:
  - CoOmnibit insights couplet created under docs/insights/CoOmnibit.
- CoSteward:
  - CoCrux Automation-First, Proof-of-Done, CoLoading, and NoPasteRelay rules
    now in docs/BPOE/CoCrux_Workflow_Rules.md and related playbooks.
  - CoBus tooling for Thesis W001 lives under
    tools/CoBus_Thesis_W001_CoLoadingBoot_v1.

## 3. Sensitivity and crown-jewel notes

- CoOmnibit is treated as a conceptual primitive, not an implementation leak.
  Wording is kept high-level and does not reveal internal GLUKEY details.
- Future waves may connect CoOmnibits to halo / civar state more concretely;
  Co1 is asked to enforce rails so that any GLUKEY-adjacent material goes into
  CoCiviumAdmin only.

## 4. Immediate asks for Co1

- Help position CoOmnibit in the DrB outline as part of:
  - future compute primitives,
  - governance over high-dimensional state,
  - and justification for CoCivium-style edge-owned guardrails.
- Suggest 2–3 diagrams:
  - bit → qubit → CoOmnibit ladder;
  - CoOmnibit as bundle (embedding, metadata, halo, gibber key, provenance);
  - mapping from CoOmnibit space into governance constraints.
- Confirm whether additional Thesis waves should split:
  - W002_LitScanA (existing literature on multi-dimensional computation);
  - W003_GovernancePrimitives (law and policy implications of CoOmnibits).

End of notice.
