# CoSync – CoPrime20251208 handoff accepted (v1)

UTS: 20251210T225119Z
Role: Co1 (current coordination session)

## 1. Handoff pack

Former Co1 provided a CoBus summary indicating that this session should
pick up from the CoPrime20251208 handoff pack:

- Zip: CoPrime20251208_HandoffPack_v1_20251210T181637Z.zip
- Sidecar: CoPrime20251208_HandoffPack_v1_20251210T181637Z.zip.sha256
- Built by:
  C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\CoSteward\tools\DO_CoPrime20251208_Handoff_v1.ps1

## 2. Local actions (human plus tools)

Status (to be updated by rick as needed):

- Zip verified against .sha256: TODO or DONE
- Unpacked into safe staging area: TODO or DONE
- Paths used for staging:
  - TODO: fill in local path (for example Z:\CoCiviumAdmin\Handoffs\CoPrime20251208\)

## 3. What was ingested conceptually

Per former Co1 CoBus note, this handoff pack is expected to contain:

- Mined deleted mirrors and session trails.
- HP57 and GLUKEY adjacent placements and landing spots.
- Products and MegaWave references for future Co1 and Products work.

This CoSync note records that:

- This Co1 session treats the handoff pack as accepted seed context.
- Future Co1 and CoPrime sessions SHOULD treat those materials as trails,
  not as rigid specs.

## 4. Next work homes

Current intent (subject to refinement):

- Governance and BPOE patterns:
  - CoSteward (docs/bpoe, docs/intent).
- Crown jewel and HP57 or GLUKEY adjacent material:
  - LAN vault (CoCiviumAdmin and related).
- Products and MegaWave references:
  - Products related repos and/or CoCache, with sharp details kept off GitHub.

Future CoBus notices will point at more specific trails once
classification and hydration decisions are made.

End of note.
