# CoPlan – CoSites constellation, seed rollback and investor readiness

UTS: 20251211T030908Z
Branch: cobus-coagent-rick-w6-v1
Scope: CoScendence, CoEvoTheory, CoPolitic, InSeed, Opename, GroupBuild, EntMent, BeAxa

## 1. Session intent (this wave)

- Protect prior bespoke work on InSeed, GroupBuild, CoPolitic, CoScendence and related sites.
- Avoid surprising other sessions or investors with sudden design or tone shifts.
- Keep the new multi site investor shells as a reusable pattern library, not a forced upgrade.
- Give Co1 a clear story it can use in decks and planning about how this was detected, rolled back and parked.

## 2. Current state (after rollback DOs)

- Live public entry point for each site is now the legacy site/index.html that was in place before v3.
- Seed v3 investor shells are parked per repo as:
  - site/index_seedv3_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.html
- For CoEvoTheory:
  - Local repo exists at ~/Documents/GitHub/CoEvoTheory.
  - site/index.html restored from latest index_legacy_*.html.
  - No git remote is configured; this repo is local only until Co1 decides otherwise.

This matches the CoBus notice CoBus_CoSites_SeedRollback_AndInvestorAdvice_*.md that has already been pushed.

## 3. Near term plan to investor safe by Friday

Target: by Friday noon, the constellation should feel coherent and defensible to investors without forcing visual uniformity.

Proposed plan:

1. **Freeze legacy faces for now**
   - Keep current legacy site/index.html as the live face for:
     - InSeed
     - GroupBuild
     - CoPolitic
     - CoScendence
     - Opename
     - EntMent
     - BeAxa
     - CoEvoTheory (local only)
   - Treat these as primary expressions of tone and posture for the next few days.

2. **Use v3 shells as a pattern and deck asset**
   - For each repo, the parked index_seedv3_*.html can be used:
     - As a layout reference when drafting investor copy.
     - As HTML screenshots in decks that show where the sites may evolve.
   - No site should silently switch its live index back to the v3 shell without a short CoBus note.

3. **Deck and narrative guidance for Co1**
   - In decks, show both:
     - Live legacy pages: demonstrate history, prior investment and real work.
     - Selected v3 shells: demonstrate forward structure, investor lens and AI portal concept.
   - Emphasise:
     - CoSeedCouple: sites start small but coherent and deepen over time.
     - CoGbx facades: every site has an AI facing portal that can scale later.
     - Quiet mode: low noise is a choice, not neglect.

4. **Guardrails for any further site changes before Friday**
   - Any change to live site/index.html on these repos should:
     - Be done on a branch or via an alternate index_*.html first.
     - Include a short CoBus note summarising what changed and why.
     - Respect existing copy and design work from prior sessions unless there is explicit agreement to replace it.

## 4. Options for CoEvoTheory

CoEvoTheory specific intent:

- Short term:
  - Keep CoEvoTheory as a local drafting ground (no remote).
  - Allow it to hold early CoEvo theory narratives, calendars and stories without investor pressure.
- Medium term options for Co1:
  - Attach a GitHub remote later once:
    - Naming and scope are clearer.
    - There is a plan for which parts are public vs private.
  - Or keep it as an internal lab repo with occasional extractions into other CoSuite sites.

## 5. Next suggested DOs (optional)

If Co1 wants more support from this lane:

1. Request a **CoDeck** pass that:
   - Captures live legacy pages and selected v3 shells as images.
   - Generates a basic investor slide pack summarising the constellation and its quiet phase posture.

2. Request a **CoSites alignment mini sweep** to:
   - Read existing copy on InSeed, GroupBuild, CoPolitic and CoScendence.
   - Propose very light edits that improve coherence and investor clarity without changing tone.

3. When ready to promote any v3 shell to live:
   - Decide per site:
     - Keep legacy index as live and treat v3 as library only.
     - Blend legacy and v3 into a new bespoke index.
     - Or promote a tuned v3 variant, with a CoBus note describing the change.

This plan is intentionally conservative. It protects prior work, keeps options open and gives Co1 a credible story about detection, repair and careful investor ramp.
