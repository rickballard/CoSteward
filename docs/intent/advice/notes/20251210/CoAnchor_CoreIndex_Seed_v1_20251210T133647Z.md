# CoAnchor Core Index seed v1 (20251210T133647Z)

- Created docs/CoAnchor/CoAnchor_CoreIndex_v1.md as a *minimal stable subset* index:
  - CC, CoPre, CoOntos, CoMeta, CoPotential, CoBloat, CoAnchor.
- Added reserved hooks for:
  - CoMegaTrain (FUTURE), CoAwe (FUTURE), CoSim / CoTestbed (EXPERIMENTAL/ALIAS).
- All entries are additive; no existing names were renamed or removed.
- This aligns with CoPre advisory:
  - Treat CoAnchor as index-of-law.
  - Prefer indexing and aliases over destructive changes.
  - Seed future hooks without forcing behavior changes.

Next steps (recommended):
- Review the index content for accuracy of homeRepo/homePath once CC/CoOntos/CoMeta files are formalized.
- Extend GIBindex / CoGibber specs later to reference these ids.
- Integrate into CoPre / CoMeta docs as needed via normal BPOE flow (branch + PR + squash).
