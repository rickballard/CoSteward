# CoPrime20251208 Handoff Summary v1

Repo: CoSteward
Generated: 20251210T181637Z
Session: prior Co1 (this session) handing off to CoPrime20251208

## What this session already set up

- CoTense spec and session header / footer templates in multiple repos.
- CoRetro BPOE and CoRetro insights triplet (theory, practice, CoMetaTrain seed).
- CoRetro_MineDeleted tool and mining pass over deleted CoGibber and reload assets.
- Initial CoBus notices to route attention to Thursday prep and handoffs.
- Early CoTabBoot guidance and CoSession header ideas.

## CoRetro_MineDeleted status

- DO_CoRetro_MineDeleted_v1.ps1 run result: tool-missing
- Public mirror (near repo) expected at:
  - docs/session-offload/mined-deleted/mirror
- Secret HP57 stash (off repo) expected at:
  - C:\CoCiviumAdmin\HP57\MinedDeleted_CoSteward

CoPrime20251208 should treat anything in HP57 paths as crown jewel or GLUKEY-adjacent
and avoid re-adding such material to public repos.

## Guidance to CoPrime20251208

Suggested next steps:

1. Pull latest CoSteward main and any active feature branches relevant to BPOE and CoRetro.
2. Inspect the handoff megazip and its sha256 sidecar in the Downloads folder.
3. Promote stable wisdom into:
   - docs/bpoe for general BPOE standards.
   - docs/CoGibber for public CoGibber specifications.
   - docs/intent/reload or successor tools if reload remains in scope.
   - tools and quickstarts for CoAnchor, CoPopupGuard, NotesAutoBranch successors.
4. For HP57 material:
   - Review offline from C:\CoCiviumAdmin\HP57\MinedDeleted_CoSteward.
   - Summarise any GLUKEY-adjacent insights in private CoPrime notes.
   - Do not commit HP57 specifics back to public repos.
5. Improve future handoffs by:
   - Having a standard CoHandoff DO tool per repo that:
     - Mines deleted content.
     - Builds a handoff pack megazip.
     - Writes a CoBus notice plus advice/notes for the next Co1.
   - Bundling these DO tools into a small public helper product
     that ships alongside RepoZipper and friends.
