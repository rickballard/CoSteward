Recommended next steps for Co1 and future stewards

- Treat the CoCivia Field Kit and v1 manifest as the default entrypoints when wiring new orchestrators or contributors.
- When CoCore is ready; create neutral pattern entries for;
  - edge; risk; hope; guardrail skeleton
  - classroom pilot patterns
  - eligibility and appeals patterns
  - civic system redesign patterns
- When CoAudit is active; standardise a short CoCivia friendly case template that includes;
  - edge group; risk; hope; guardrails
  - misuse patterns seen
  - follow up owner and date

BPOE reminder

- Repo is source of truth.
- CoCivia v1 spine is now anchored in CoCivia; referenced here for Co1; CoSteward; and future orchestration work.
