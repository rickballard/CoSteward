# CoSync – Seed rails for CoPingPong and CoRegen

## When

- UTS: 20251124T010326Z

## Repos touched

- CoSteward

## What landed in this wave

- Seeded CoStyle seed stage guide:
  - docs/bpoe/CoStyle_SeedStage_Guide_v1.md

- Seeded CoPermanence doctrine:
  - docs/ops/CoPermanence_Doctrine_v0.1.md

- Seeded CoPingPong tutorial notes:
  - docs/ops/CoPingPong_Tutorial_Notes_Rick_v0.1.md
  - Added error-handling and sandbox hygiene guidance.

- Seeded CoRegen protocol:
  - docs/ops/CoRegen_Protocol_v0.1.md

- Seeded CoSurfing / CoVibeSurfing rails:
  - docs/ops/CoSurfing_Workflow_Lexicon_v0.1.md
  - Paired with CoVibeSurfing insight files in CoCivium (separate commit there).

- Updated PS7 prompt profile locally:
  - CoSuite PS7 prompt marker v3 for black background and yellow prompt.

## Next obvious steps

- Link these docs from CoSteward profile template and any BPOE indices.
- Fold CoRegen semantics into broader doctrine and CoAgent design notes.
- Plan the next MegaWave to:
  - Align CoSteward and CoCivium indices,
  - Move more of the “rails” into reusable bundles for CoAgent.

## Notes

- CoRegen is now the canonical trigger for refreshing sandbox artifacts between waves.
- BPOE assumption: anything rendered as a code block is eligible for CoPing and must be runnable PS7.
