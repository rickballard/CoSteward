# Products20251128 – Scope Note (v1)

Session label: `Products20251128`  
Original CoPortal: `CoArena20251128` → later widened to products focus.

## Intent

- Start from CoArena Medals+Ref MVP work in `CoAgent`.
- Realize that this pattern (two AIs argue, ref + medal, PTAG write) is a good
  **template for many products**.
- Use this session to seed:
  - A generic **Products Ramp Pattern**,
  - A first-pass **CoModules** shopping list,
  - A playful but purposeful **civar** facet proposal.

## What this bundle leaves behind

1. `Products_Ramp_Pattern_v1.md`
   - A standard way to describe product identity, surfaces, backend rails,
     lifecycle stages, PTAG facets, CoModules, and ownership.

2. `CoModules_SeedList_v1.md`
   - A list of candidate shared modules (CoFlowCore, CoPTAGCore, CoMeritRank,
     CoEdgeAuth, CoCacheCore, CoUXPrompts, etc.).

3. `CoArena_Civar_PTAG_Facet_v1.md`
   - A spec seed for a “civar” value facet, tied initially to CoArena
     `arena_result` envelopes but intended to generalize.

4. `MW_ProductsRamp_CoModules_README_v1.md`
   - Practical placement notes and quick orientation.

## Relationship to CoPrime / Co1

- This session is **not** trying to define a permanent hierarchy (Co1, Co2, etc.).
- It is acting as a **productization facet** that:
  - Suggests rails CoPrime can adopt,
  - Provides seeds but does not enforce them.
- CoPrime / CoSteward are free to merge, rename, or split these assets in future
  waves.

## Suggested next waves

- For CoPrime / CoSteward:
  - Decide whether to formalize “product ramp” as a first-class standard.
  - Begin mapping 2–3 existing products onto the ramp to prove reuse.
  - Gradually align actual code and scripts with CoModules names.

- For CoArena:
  - Integrate civar capture (even if crudely) after each Medals+Ref match.
  - Start reading logs and building simple summaries per topic / steward.

This note should be treated as advisory context, not a binding spec.
