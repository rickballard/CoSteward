# CoSteward – crypto / FinFlow rails scan – session close

Repo: `CoSteward`  
Path: `Insights` (FF_ / EC_ / OB_ / BM_ files)

- Ran a targeted insight sweep for FinFlow / crypto / token / black-gray-market / amnesty / ledger themes, focusing on `FF_`, `EC_`, `OB_`, `BM_` insight files.
- Verified that any relevant rails-related insights are captured in files under version control (nothing left only in transient chat).
- No further changes are pending in this wave; future crypto / rails work should treat these committed insights as the starting point.

Outcome: this CoSteward session is considered fully synced to repo with respect to crypto / FinFlow / black-/gray-market rails. Future evolution of these patterns should start from the committed insight files and this note.
