# Advisory: Project CoCourier – Breaking the Session Wall (v1)

This advisory introduces **CoCourier**, a new CoSuite meta-infrastructure project designed to eliminate the current dependency on Rick manually copy/pasting content between sessions. It enables:

- Many-to-many multi-session orchestration  
- Machine-driven session bootstrapping  
- High-bandwidth parallel MegaWaves (“Tsunamis”)  
- Consistent global synchronization across the CoSuite  
- Reduction of repo state-clashes and orchestration drift  

## Why CoCourier Exists

Current sessions cannot access or ingest CoBus automatically.  
Rick is forced to be the physical courier, bridging repo-truth and chat-truth.

This breaks BPOE Rule #1: *make life easier for users*,  
and severely limits scalability of CoSuite evolution.

## What CoCourier Enables

- Automated CoBus-based context injection at session creation  
- Local tooling to generate bootstrap blocks  
- Unified session-federation architecture  
- Multi-agent collaborative editing of repos safely  
- Massive parallelization of workflow  
- Future CoCivIA autonomy and auto-evo loops  

## What Co1 Must Do

1. Define CoCourier Spec in CoSteward  
2. Architect cross-repo integration in CoCore  
3. Build bootstrap client and loaders  
4. Update CoIndex  
5. Update Master Plan and BPOE  
6. Begin first operational integration wave (v1→v2)

## Handoff

This advisory should be treated as the formal initiation of CoCourier (v1).  
See CoBus note `CoCourier_Initiation_v1` for the canonical payload.
