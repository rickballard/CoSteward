# Session Plan: CoTips – Manual Update

**Scope (this session only):**
- Add/adjust manual entries; create placeholder for CoTips.
- Record open topics (here-strings/backticks pain; Megazip BPOE default; downloadables policy).
- Publish checklist + CoSync note for Co1 visibility.

**Definition of Done:**
- PR open with Plan, Checklist, CoSync note.
- Manual index links to CoTips page (placeholder OK).
- CoSync note references PR number and file paths.

**Non-goals (defer to next sessions):**
- Full Megazip pattern write-up and scripts.
- Detailed CoTips on here-strings/ticks.
- Downloadables policy enforcement automation.

**Risks / Mitigations:**
- Title-ish/ugly layout → keep changes minimal; content-first.
- Chat UI backtick fragility → prefer file writes over giant DO blocks.

**Next sessions (candidates):**
- docs: CoTips–Megazip
- docs: CoTips–HereStrings & Backticks
- docs: CoTips–Downloadables Policy
