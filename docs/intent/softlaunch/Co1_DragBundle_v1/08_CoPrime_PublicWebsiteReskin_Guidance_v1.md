# CoPrime Advisory – Public Website Reskin Guidance v1

```yaml
co_wave: Co1_DragBundle_v1
co_class: gray
co_sweep:
  repos: [CoIndex, CoSteward, CoCache]
```

## 1. Scope

Advise sessions responsible for public sites (CoCivium, CoPolitic, etc.) that:

- we are entering a **SoftLaunchOrbit / stealth-ish** phase,
- the VR civic engine wedge is front-and-centre,
- deeper civic OS and macro content is secondary for now.

## 2. Suggested changes

- Keep InSeed.com clearly commercial and advisory-facing.
- For other CoSuite sites:
  - emphasise “experiments / research / early-stage work”,
  - flag content as “working notes” where appropriate,
  - avoid strong claims that might invite premature scrutiny.
