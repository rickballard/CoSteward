# Routing Map – CoCivium_Co1_DragBundle_v1

```yaml
co_wave: Co1_DragBundle_v1
co_class: gray
```

## 1. Instruction to Co1

When these files are dragged into Co1 from Rick’s Downloads folder, please:

1. **Archive the raw bundle**
   - Store a copy of all 10 files under a suitable `/handoff` or `/inbox` path for traceability.

2. **Proposed routing**

- Strategy / narrative docs:
  - `01_SoftLaunchOrbit_VRLayer_v1.md`
  - `02_VRLaunch_Strategy_v1.md`
  - `03_VR_IdentityEvolution_v1.md`
  - `04_Civar_MarketAndLegacyMapping_v1.md`
  - `09_SoftLaunch_To_MacroCivium_Integration_v1.md`
  → propose into CoCivium / CoSteward / CoIndex under intent/strategy.

- Darren-facing pivot framing (supporting material):
  - `05_PivotNarrative_ForDarren_v1.md`
  → keep alongside investor-facing materials and Friday kits.

- Internal strategy / camouflage:
  - `06_StrategicCamouflage_Playbook_v1.md`
  → keep in internal/gray area; do not surface broadly.

- CoPrime advisories:
  - `07_CoPrime_Substack_Update_Instructions_v1.md`
  - `08_CoPrime_PublicWebsiteReskin_Guidance_v1.md`
  → route to CoPrime-related handoff locations; from there, sessions can act when Rick side-loads Substack or site content.

3. **Versioning**

Treat this bundle as **v1** of the SoftLaunchOrbit / Civars+VR integration wave.
When significant repo changes are made based on these docs, create updated `..._v2.md` as needed.
