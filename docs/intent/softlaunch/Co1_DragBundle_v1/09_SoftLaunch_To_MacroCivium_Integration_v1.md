## 1. Two horizons

- **Horizon 1:** VR / gaming civic engine.
- **Horizon 2:** broader civic OS and hybrid-society governance tooling.

## 2. Integration path

- Learn from VR worlds:
  - what makes civic incentives work or fail,
  - how halos are perceived and used,
  - how governance tools are adopted or ignored.
- Feed these lessons into:
  - CoMetaTrain (nD representations),
  - GIBindex concepts,
  - future institutional pilots.

SoftLaunchOrbit is the **data / UX apprenticeship** for the bigger civic mission.
