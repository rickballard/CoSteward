## 1. Context

Some external actors (e.g. critics of heterodox economics) may misinterpret or attack CoCivium’s deeper aims.

## 2. Camouflage principle

- Lead with:
  - “VR civic engine improving communities and retention.”
- Do **not** foreground:
  - critiques of existing macro systems,
  - “world-saving” rhetoric,
  - political framings.

## 3. Tactics

- Use neutral, product-oriented language in public artifacts.
- Reserve deeper critique and long-arc material for:
  - internal notes,
  - carefully chosen audiences,
  - or vault-only content.
