# SoftLaunchOrbit – VR Layer Overview v1

    - pattern: "game community governance"
```

## 1. Purpose

Define the **SoftLaunchOrbit**: a VR / gaming–first launch vector for CoCivium that is:
- low-political-risk,
- commercially legible,
- technically feasible with a small team,
- and faithful to CoCivium’s long-term civic OS intent.

## 2. Core idea

Start CoCivium as a **civic + reputation engine for virtual worlds**, not as a government-facing product:

- integrate into 1–3 VR / game titles,
- provide halo-style multi-dimensional reputation (“Civars → halos”),
- ship basic governance tools (polls, roles, councils),
- measure impact on retention, toxicity, and community health.

## 3. Why VR / games first

- Players already accept synthetic economies and abstract stats.
- Studios actively struggle with moderation, toxicity, churn.
- It’s safer: fewer entrenched political/legacy interests than in formal civic institutions.
- It gives CoCivium real-world data and UX practice in a forgiving environment.

## 4. Alignment with CoCivium’s long arc

SoftLaunchOrbit is **not a pivot away** from the civic OS vision; it is the most workable:
- first proving ground for Civars/halos,
- data engine for CoMetaTrain,
- demo environment for hybrid human–AI governance tools.
