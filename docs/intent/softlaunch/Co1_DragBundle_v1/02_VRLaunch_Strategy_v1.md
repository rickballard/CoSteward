```

## 1. Targets

- VR social platforms and PC/console games with:
  - strong community features (guilds, clans, hubs),
  - ongoing live-ops,
  - an interest in reducing toxicity and churn.

## 2. Entry product

- A **drop-in civic engine** for studios:
  - SDK / plugin (Unity/Unreal),
  - REST/GraphQL endpoints,
  - default UI components for halo display and civic actions.

## 3. Partner strategy (Phase 1)

- Identify 1–3 **friendly early partners** willing to experiment:
  - maybe mid-sized studios, indie MMOs, or VR social spaces.
- Offer:
  - design support,
  - integration assistance,
  - co-authored case studies if results are strong.

## 4. Narrative positioning (for studios)

- “We help your world become:
  - less toxic,
  - more welcoming to newcomers,
  - and more meaningfully governable by your players.”

Not: “We’re here to impose governance theory.”
