## 1. Story spine

1. Started with a **broad civic OS** vision (CoCivium).
2. Realised that direct institutional adoption is:
   - slow,
   - political,
   - risk-heavy.
3. Observed that VR / games already host:
   - massive “citizen” populations,
   - synthetic economies,
   - genuine governance problems.
4. Concluded the **cleanest first deployment** is:
   - a civic + reputation engine for these worlds.

## 2. Key reassurance

- This is not abandoning the long-term thesis.
- It’s choosing a **tractable first proving ground** with:
  - clear business value,
  - fast feedback loops,
  - and huge upside if it works.
