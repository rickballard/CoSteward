# VR Identity Evolution – From Avatars to CoCivites v1

```yaml
co_wave: Co1_DragBundle_v1
co_class: public
co_sweep:
  repos: [CoIndex]
  external:
    - pattern: "avatar identity and progression"
```

## 1. Principle

Use **game avatars and accounts** as a gentle, low-stakes testbed for future CoCivium identities.

## 2. Identity layers

- **Avatar-level** halo:
  - what this character has done in this world.
- **Account-level** halo:
  - cross-character civic history in a single game.
- **Cross-world seed** (later):
  - opt-in, pseudonymous mapping of halos across worlds.

## 3. Guardrails

- No forced real-name or real-world identity linkage.
- No tradable “social credit” token.
- Clear player control over what leaves the game and under what terms.
