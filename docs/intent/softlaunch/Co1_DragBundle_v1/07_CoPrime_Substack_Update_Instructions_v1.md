# CoPrime Advisory – Substack Article Update v1

```yaml
co_wave: Co1_DragBundle_v1
co_class: gray
co_sweep:
  repos: [RickPublic, CoIndex]
```

## 1. Intent

Guide CoPrime on advising Rick to update a specific Substack article so that:

- it remains a faithful record of past thinking,
- it acknowledges subsequent critique and new understanding,
- it does not look like stealth revisionism.

## 2. Recommended pattern

- Add a clearly dated **Editor’s Note** at the top:
  - acknowledge that certain quoted views or frameworks have been challenged,
  - state that the article is preserved “as-was” for transparency,
  - optionally link to a newer piece that refines the stance.
- Do not:
  - silently rewrite the article into something different,
  - erase the original context.
