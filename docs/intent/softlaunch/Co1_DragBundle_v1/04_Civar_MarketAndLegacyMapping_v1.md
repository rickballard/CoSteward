# Civars – Market & Legacy-World Mapping v1

```yaml

## 1. What a civar is (market-facing)

In VR / games, a **civar** can be explained as:

> “A logged moment of positive civic behavior in the world.”

Examples:
- mentoring a new player,
- resolving a conflict,
- hosting inclusive events,
- reporting abuse accurately.

## 2. Legacy-world analogues

Civars resemble:

- peer endorsements,
- track records of leadership / contribution,
- high-trust references.

But remain **in-world first**; any real-world mapping is optional and later.

## 3. Market implications

- In a mature form, civars could back:
  - better matchmaking and team assembly,
  - curated communities,
  - even hiring/credential signals.
- Early on, civars are **purely in-world** and non-tradable.
