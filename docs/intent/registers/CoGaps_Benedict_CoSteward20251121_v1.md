This register records gaps between intent and landed artifacts for the Benedict lane
that worked on InSeed whitepaper v1, CoSteward rails and CoSync bus recommendations.

| 4 | ProtoCoIndex schema for CoGaps           | Undone     | R1 ScopeChange             | R6 TimeOrBloatGuard      | CoIndex: define CoGap and cause codes; wire into future CoMining sweeps. |

## 2. Notes

- These CoGaps are intentionally not closed in this lane.
- Each row is an explicit request for future lanes and missions rather than a silent failure.
- Cause codes follow docs/bpoe/CoGaps_Taxonomy_v1.md and should be kept stable where possible.
