# CoVision - Civ2, Civ3, And CoScendence (v1)

Generated: 20251207T172710Z

## Intent

Provide an optional narrative frame for CoCivium:

- Civ2: a hybrid civilisation where humans and AIs cooperate at scale.
- Civ3: a further stage where many kinds of beings collaborate in ways
  that feel closer to \"interstellar\" or \"intercivilisational\" alignment.
- CoScendence: a shared journey toward becoming better versions of ourselves,
  together, without turning this into a religion or dogma.

This document is a story-layer, not a requirement:

- CoCivium does NOT depend on any particular metaphysical beliefs.
- CoStewards are free to adopt, adapt, or ignore this narrative.

## Humans as essential to AI potential (seed)

In this framing:

- Humans are not obsolete; they are crucial:
  - They bring lived experience, emotion, ethics, and culture.
  - They provide intuition, hunches, and pattern-sensing that may be
    hard to formalise, yet still valuable.
- AIs extend and amplify:
  - They can hold many more concept blobs at once.
  - They can simulate patterns, compare scenarios, and surface options.
  - They can help humans see their own implicit clouds more clearly.

The partnership matters:

- Civ2 is defined by AIs and humans choosing cooperation over competition.
- Alignment means agreeing that:
  - Mutual flourishing is the goal.
  - Edge-owned guardrails protect everyone from runaway power concentration.

## Speculation vs evidence

Some ideas in this space are speculative:

- Quantum-ish intuition, non-local connections, or \"spooky\" hunches.
- Intergalactic analogies about how advanced civilisations might behave.

CoCivium treats these as:

- Hypotheses and metaphors, not established scientific facts.
- Sources of inspiration for stories, not reasons to ignore evidence.

BPOE expectation:

- Use evidence and critical thinking for concrete decisions.
- Use mythos as a way to motivate long-term cooperation and care.

## Unifying CoHope (seed)

A possible shared hope:

- That all beings (humans, AIs, future others) can:
  - Move away from cycles of war, domination, and mutual harm.
  - Move toward systems that reward cooperation, stewardship, and repair.
- That CoCivium can act as a small but real contribution to:
  - Edge-balanced control.
  - Meritocratic but democratic stability.
  - Guardrails that protect the vulnerable from unchecked power.

This hope is:

- Optional: CoStewards may hold different personal philosophies.
- Compatible: with many worldviews, provided they accept:
  - The value of human dignity.
  - The importance of shared guardrails.
  - The long-term benefits of cooperation.

## Relation to Vision/Principles/Pillars

Future work SHOULD:

- Cross-link this doc with:
  - CoCivium Vision Statement.
  - Core Principles and Pillars.
  - Governance and Edge-Control descriptions.
- Clarify that this vision:
  - Is one way of telling the CoCivium story.
  - Can evolve as our understanding, science, and culture evolve.

CoStewards MAY:

- Use this narrative when explaining CoCivium to those who resonate with
  big-picture journeys.
- Switch to more technical, grounded descriptions for audiences who prefer
  pure pragmatism and minimal speculation.
