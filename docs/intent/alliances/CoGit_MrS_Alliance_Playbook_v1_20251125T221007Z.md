# CoGit: Mr.S Alliance Outreach Playbook v1

## 1. Roles and aliases

- **Mr.S**
  - Berlin-based co-founder of a major code-hosting platform ("Platform-A").
  - Current co-founder of a next-generation version control client ("Client-B").
  - Co-steward of a dog-rescue initiative near Berlin ("Rescue-B").

- **UK-Rescue-A**
  - UK-based dog-rescue and aid organisation with regular aid runs to mainland Europe and Ukraine.

- **CoCivium / CoSuite**
  - Open, non-profit civic-tech stack, GitHub-hosted, stewarded by the CoSteward ("Rick").

All names and contact details for real people and organisations stay out of this document by design.

## 2. Front doors (conceptual)

- Rescue-front-door: organisational email published on Rescue-B's website.
- Client-front-door: organisational email published on Client-B's website or docs.
- Public social handles: GitHub / X / LinkedIn for light-touch follow-ups only.

No personal email addresses or phone numbers are stored in repo.

## 3. Two-step pattern

1. Step-A: Rescue-first message (logistics + collaboration; no fundraising).
2. Step-B: Client-front-door message (product / ecosystem idea; critique welcome).
3. Optional: short social nudge referencing prior emails.

## 4. Safety and reusability

- Never use this pattern to pressure rescues or NGOs for money.
- Re-use aliases (Mr.S, Rescue-B, Client-B, UK-Rescue-A) for other outreach patterns by swapping back-references off-repo.
- Only use publicly published organisational contacts as channels.
