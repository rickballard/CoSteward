# CoSites polish plan (v1)

UTS seed: 20251212T152812Z  
Repo: CoSteward  

This note tracks polish and alignment work for the main steward-facing sites.

## 1. InSeed.com (founder / steward facing)

### Role

- Founder and steward facing site.
- Anchored in the new Steward worldview.
- Primary home for:
  - Strategy pivots into AI and hybrid society.
  - Steward minded governance and risk balancing.
  - Productization of trust and guardrails.

### Current status (rough)

- Live domain still shows legacy InSeed site.
- New content lives on repo only.
- CoBus advisory seed exists:

  - docs/intent/cobus/CoBus_InSeed_StewardSites_Advisory_v1_20251208T222443Z.md

### Near term polish targets

- [ ] Confirm up to date content tree for new InSeed.com.
- [ ] Decide hosting / preview path for reviewing new site.
- [ ] Plan DNS / hosting cutover steps from legacy to Steward framed site.
- [ ] Define where, if anywhere, legacy InSeed archive will live.

## 2. CoPolitic.org (civic / government facing)

### Role

- Civic offices, ministries, agencies, NGOs, and policy actors.
- Audience that responds better to:
  - Whitepapers.
  - Slide decks.
  - Conservative and compliance flavored narratives.

### Current status (rough)

- TOS AI era whitepaper and "dino deck" exist as useful legacy assets.
- Links may be broken or point at older hosting.
- Needs framing that these are legacy primers, not current canon.

### Near term polish targets

- [ ] Inventory current CoPolitic.org repo and hosting.
- [ ] Ensure stable PDFs for:
  - Whitepaper.
  - Dino deck.
- [ ] Fix or replace broken links.
- [ ] Add framing that these are legacy primers leading toward Steward / CoCivium view.

## 3. CoCivium.org (movement / ecosystem facing)

### Role

- Public movement and ecosystem hub.
- Explains:
  - CoCivium vision.
  - CoEvolutionary Systemics.
  - Hybrid human + AI stewardship roles.

### Current status (rough)

- Assets spread across multiple repos (CoCivium, CoCache, CoIndex, CoSteward, others).
- Needs clear narrative that ties:
  - CoSteward role.
  - CoCivia / CoCivIA.
  - CoPortals and CoCacheGlobal.
  - Halo and merit signals.

### Near term polish targets

- [ ] Confirm canonical repo(s) for CoCivium.org site.
- [ ] Draft section map (home, concepts, participation, for stewards, for institutions).
- [ ] Identify which assets can be public now vs later.
- [ ] Align terminology with current GIBindex seeds.

---

## 4. CoSteward docs as a site (BPOE / operations)

### Role

- Human readable view of BPOE, rails, and operating expectations.
- Reference for:
  - CoBus notices.
  - Session rescue and reload tools.
  - MegaWave / AdviceBomb practices.

### Current status (rough)

- Many strong seeds:
  - BPOE v2 delta branch.
  - CoGibber onboarding notes.
  - Session rescue and reload tools.
- Not yet arranged as a simple, navigable "ops site" for new stewards.

### Near term polish targets

- [ ] Identify which CoSteward docs should appear as a "site like" top level.
- [ ] Propose simple navigation structure for:
  - New stewards.
  - Returning stewards.
  - Toolsmiths and contributors.
- [ ] Decide whether to publish this as a static site or keep as repo-only docs for now.

---

## 5. Other CoSites (placeholders)

These will be populated in later waves as needed:

- [ ] CoAgent / CoArena public site and docs.
- [ ] RickPublic / newsletter landing surfaces.
- [ ] Any partner or lane-specific sites that depend on CoSteward rails.

---

## 6. Cross cutting rails

Shared expectations for all sites:

- Repo-first, automation-first.
- CoBus notes as steering memos rather than ad hoc edits.
- Clear separation of:
  - Legacy assets (primers, archives).
  - Current canon (Steward / CoCivium view).
- Explicit pointers into:
  - CoSteward.
  - CoCache / CoIndex.
  - Relevant CoBus advisories.
