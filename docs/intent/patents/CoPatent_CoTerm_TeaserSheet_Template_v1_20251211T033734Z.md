# CoPatent CoTerm Teaser Sheet – Template v1

UTS: 20251211T033734Z

Purpose:

- Provide a one glance list of patent related CoTerms.
- Spark curiosity for Darren and selected investors.
- Stay within CoPatents_BPOE_v1 safety rails.
- Keep sharp detail in LAN vaults and with patent counsel only.

This template SHOULD be cloned and filled out in a vault friendly location
for actual use. A sanitised version MAY live on repo if it stays vague.

---

## 1. Usage

For each CoTerm:

- Choose a short name.
- Give a one line, vague teaser description.
- Label:
  - Risk class (Low, Medium, High, CrownJewel).
  - Disclosure level (PublicTeaser, NDAOnly, CounselOnly).
  - Vault reference (optional).

- Keep descriptions at high level.
- Omit or blur VaultRefHint.
