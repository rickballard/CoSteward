## Notes

- Secrets > 0 would be P1 according to CoProtect_BPOE; currently all 0 in this snapshot.
- HP57 refs show where docs talk about HP57/HP57_ROOT; not all are exposures, but they are candidates for review.
- CoProtect-tagged assets indicate where CoAsset_IntentCloud_v1 has already been applied.

Next steps are driven jointly by CoPrime/Co1 and Outreach&BP using Scan-CoExposure outputs.
