# CoReload Dashboard (v1)

Generated: 20251208T115210Z

This page gives a quick view of the CoReload lane for this repo.

## Why CoReload exists

- Session memory forgets and compresses unpredictably.
- Attachments in ChatGPT are not durable storage.
- CoReload snapshots pull session inputs down into repo, where they are stable.

Repo root: C:\Users\Chris\Documents\GitHub\CoSteward

## How to use this dashboard

- When session memory feels thin, run a CoReload wave.
- Check this dashboard to confirm snapshots exist and include your key advisories.
- Use git history on this file and the snapshot files to audit recovery events.

## Next steps (manual)

- Add this file to git and commit CoReload-related changes together with snapshots.
- Optionally, link this dashboard from other CoSteward overview docs.

End of CoReload Dashboard v1.
