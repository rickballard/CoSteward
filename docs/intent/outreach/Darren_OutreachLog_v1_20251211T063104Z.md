## Email body (as sent)

> Darren, I know you are swamped, so if this afternoon and/or evening doesn't work out for you, ping me to postpone.  No pressure, no haste.  We are already private equity-(InSeed) funded to YE2027, (our investor roadshow runway).
>
> Patent lawyers I was directed toward:
> Christopher Brown at Gowlings
> Bradley White at Osler
> Team-lawyers, global, domain-expert, fast, defense strategic for complex portfolios, can recognize rejects, but mind-numbingly f*ckin' expensive!
>
> To save time (= money), we will present near final drafts.  They will just need to accept, edit and file globally.  Worst case, the provisionals stand for 2 to 3-years, while "sharp lawyering" (e.g. delays) buy us time to grow virally-into critical mass incumbency.
>
> Then we pivot to quasi-commercial, with a unique story to tell your AI-bio-enhanced grand-kids.
