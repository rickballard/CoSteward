# CoPingPong tutorial notes (Rick method) v0.1

These notes capture one practiced way of doing CoPingPong between AI and PS7.

## Core habits

- Use a single PS7 window as the "arena" for many sessions.
- Pause when PS7 output seems stuck to see whether it completes without intervention.
- Only CoPong a CoStatus line if the CoPing output actually offers one.
- Use Ctrl + C aggressively to get back to a clean prompt.
- Hit Enter many times (for example 10) to visually separate CoPongs from the next CoPing output.
- Say the name or label of each CoBlock out loud while copying it.
- When pasting, say "and <name>" to re-engage audio memory and stay oriented across sessions.
- Color terminal tabs and browser tabs so that each PS7 panel matches one or more AI sessions.
- If PS7 capacity is full, ask sessions to produce .md advisories for Co1 instead of trying to reach the advice inbox directly.
- Give each new session a Quickstart grenade and explain that direct repo access awaits a CoPortal on CoCivium.org.
- Treat the future CoPortal as an alien looking, gibber heavy site, optimised for AI efficiency and concept based indexing.
- Reinforce preferences continuously:
  - prefer MegaWaves,
  - prefer repo first moves,
  - prefer pushing productivity and capacity limits to learn CoBloat boundaries.

## Teaching angle

- Emphasise that CoPingPong is a learned rhythm, not a rigid protocol.
- Stress that mistakes are expected: Ctrl + C and visual spacing are part of the hygiene.
- Make it clear that "local" PS7 behavior is a staging area; nothing "counts" until it becomes a sharable artifact or repo change.

## Error handling and sandbox hygiene

- When you see red error output in PS7, stop the current wave:
  - Do not run the rest of the CoBlock body.
  - CoPong the error snippet plus the CoBlock header back to the AI.
  - Let the AI fix the block and resend before you continue.

- Treat each PS7 run as authoritative over instructions lower in the same AI reply.
  - If reality (red) and the plan disagree, believe the red.

- Only run the CoBlock region:
  - Paste from the `# [NN] ███ DO ...` header down to the `# /DO` line.
  - If you see plain prose like "That MegaWave should:" or markdown bullets starting with `-` in PS7, you''ve copied too much.
  - Hit Ctrl + C, add spacing, and paste a cleaner slice of just the CoBlock.

- Sandbox and code interpreter expiry:
  - Assume that download links and generated files live in a short-lived sandbox on the AI side.
  - If a link feels stale, refresh the page or start a new chat, then ask the AI to regenerate the asset inside the fresh sandbox.
  - Ask the AI to confirm the file exists in its sandbox before you download, for example:
    - "List the files in your sandbox."
    - "Confirm that MW_PS7_PromptMarker_v2.ps1 exists and show its path."

- Download timing:
  - Prefer to download assets soon after they are generated instead of leaving them to drift across many waves.
  - If you suspect a regenerated file may reuse a name, ask the AI to include a version stamp or date in the filename.

- Windows downloads and filename collisions:
  - Browsers may auto-append (1), (2), etc. when filenames collide.
  - When in doubt, keep only the most recent version and archive or delete superseded copies.

These habits reduce confusion, make CoPingPong safer, and keep CoStatusLocal closer to green.
