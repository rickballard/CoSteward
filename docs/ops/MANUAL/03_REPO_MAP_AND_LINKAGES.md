# Repo Map & Linkages

Core repos (examples; expand with exact links):
- CoSteward (ops, BPOE, handbooks, CoSync policy)
- CoCache (indexing, advice-inbox, megascroll assembly)
- CoAgent (governance container, 4-panel UI)
- CoContrib (contributor onboarding + PR flow)
- CoCivium (diagrams, public assets, site)

Cross-links: CI jobs, shared scripts, AdviceBomb paths, and READMEs must point to canonical sources on **main**.
