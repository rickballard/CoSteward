# Overview

Purpose: explain assets → processes → CI → evolution loops (CoEvo) end-to-end.

Key ideas:
- Violet Receipts: progress summary, copy/paste from PS7 panel to AI chat.
- Repo-first (BPOE): short branch → PR → squash-merge → verify on main.
- AdviceBombs are zip-deliverables with manifests + checksums + CI guards.
- CoSync keeps sessions and repos aligned (policy-driven cadence).
- Megascrolls: human-narrative views assembled from indexed sources.
