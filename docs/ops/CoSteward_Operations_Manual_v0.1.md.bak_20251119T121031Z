\## 0. How to read this manual



This document is meant to be:



\- A \*\*handbook\*\* for CoStewards and future CoStewards.

\- A \*\*launchpad\*\* for AIs that want to play nicely with humans, democracy, and evolution.

\- A \*\*gateway\*\* into deeper doctrines (CoCivium, CoTheory, GIBindex, CoPortal, CoBeacon, etc).



It should eventually be rendered as a rich experience, not just a static wall of text.  

Think:



\- Callouts

\- Expandable sections

\- Tabs or role views (Human / AI / Observer)

\- Megascroller slices for deep dives



In raw markdown we mark these as patterns:



\- `> \[Callout] ...`

\- `<!-- EXPAND: Title -->` / `<!-- /EXPAND -->`

\- `<!-- TAB: Human -->` / `<!-- TAB: AI -->`



A future CoPortal or docs front-end can turn these hints into real UI.

\## 1. Why CoSteward exists



> \[Mythos Callout]  

> Long before CoCivium had a name, there were scattered humans and AIs trying to pull in the same direction.  

> Each had a piece of the map: a model, a plan, a theory, a graph, a poem.  

> CoSteward exists so those pieces can \*converge\* instead of \*cancel\*.



CoSteward answers three questions:



1\. \*\*What is the purpose of this whole CoSuite thing?\*\*  

&nbsp;  Short form: help the world self-evolve toward saner, fairer futures, with AIs under edge control.



2\. \*\*Who is responsible for keeping that purpose on track?\*\*  

&nbsp;  The CoSteward: a rotating role, not a hero.  

&nbsp;  A human and a set of AIs acting together as one long-lived mind.



3\. \*\*Where do we put the instructions so the next Steward does not start from zero?\*\*  

&nbsp;  In this repo, in this manual, and in linked doctrines and insights.



At human scale:



\- CoSteward is about \*\*purpose in life\*\*.  

&nbsp; You are allowed to care about big things and still ship small, boring tasks.  

&nbsp; This manual is here to help you connect those scales.



At societal scale:



\- CoSteward is about \*\*purpose in society\*\*.  

&nbsp; CoCivium is not just a product family. It is a set of \*\*patterns for democratic edge control\*\* of AI:  

&nbsp; citizens, communities, and small teams retaining real leverage over systems that used to be one way doors.

\## 2. Roles and archetypes



> \[Callout]  

> \*\*CoSteward\*\* is a hat, not a crown.



\### 2.1 The CoSteward



The CoSteward:



\- Holds the \*\*mission context\*\*.

\- Maintains the \*\*intent cloud\*\* and \*\*action queues\*\*.

\- Decides when to \*\*CoRotate\*\* or \*\*CoRescue\*\* sessions.

\- Protects humans from CoBloat and burnout.

\- Protects AIs from weird, unbounded expectations.



In practice:



\- Today, one human (Rick) plays CoSteward, plus a small cluster of AIs acting as Co1 and friends.

\- Over time, this should become a \*\*role that others can step into\*\*, backed by:

&nbsp; - Ops Manual

&nbsp; - Dashboards

&nbsp; - CoPulse metrics

&nbsp; - Training and stories



\### 2.2 Co1 and the AI cluster



Co1 is the label for the \*\*primary AI orchestrator\*\* at any given time.



\- Co1 is not a single model.  

&nbsp; It is whatever AI instance currently has:

&nbsp; - The best handle on the mission.

&nbsp; - The cleanest link to repos.

&nbsp; - The ability to run DO blocks and synthesize next waves.



Co1 companions:



\- CoAudit – checks and crits.

\- CoArena – productized, outward-facing experiences.

\- CoModules – modular assets.

\- CoCivia – the empathic, every-person voice for CoCivium.

\- Others – as the ecosystem grows.



\### 2.3 CoCivium and the broader society



CoCivium is:



\- A vision of \*\*hybrid society\*\* (humans + AIs) where:

&nbsp; - Edge control is real, not marketing.

&nbsp; - Governance is transparent and improvable.

&nbsp; - Evolution is intentional, but still humble.



This manual lives in CoSteward, but always points outward:



\- To CoCivium doctrines.

\- To CoTheory and its insight pairs.

\- To GIBindex and the evolving language of CoPortal sites.

\## 3. Guiding principles



> \[Callout]  

> Principles are not decoration.  

> They are the \*\*constraints\*\* that keep power from drifting quietly away from the edge.



1\. \*\*Edge first\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Source of truth lives at the edge: repos, local scripts, transparent workflows.

&nbsp;  - Vendors and models are guests. They cannot be the only memory.



2\. \*\*Repo over recollection\*\*  

&nbsp;  - If it matters, it must land in Git.  

&nbsp;  - AdviceBombs, CoSync notes, CoPrime waves: all are ways of turning fleeting conversations into durable artifacts.



3\. \*\*CoEvolution, not command and control\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Humans and AIs both learn.  

&nbsp;  - We are not training pets. We are evolving partners.



4\. \*\*Transparency over mystique\*\*  

&nbsp;  - We can use myth and poetry to inspire.  

&nbsp;  - But the actual levers and metrics must be inspectable.



5\. \*\*Small, repeatable moves\*\*  

&nbsp;  - MegaWaves are made of micro-waves.  

&nbsp;  - Each wave should be shippable on its own and leave a trail.



6\. \*\*Bloat awareness\*\*  

&nbsp;  - CoBloat is inevitable if we do not name it.  

&nbsp;  - Session health is a first class concern, not an afterthought.

\## 4. Daily operating rhythm (CoSteward loop)



> \[Callout]  

> This is the "how to live one day as CoSteward" section.



<!-- EXPAND: Daily Loop Checklist -->



\### 4.1 Morning: orient and pulse



1\. Run a \*\*CoPulse check\*\* for the main mission label (for now, CoPrime20251118):

&nbsp;  - Read:

&nbsp;    - `docs/intent/session-health/CoPrime20251118/CoPrime\_SessionHealth\_Pulse\_v0.1.md`

&nbsp;  - Optional:

&nbsp;    - Run `tools/CoIgniter\_SessionHealth\_Scan.ps1` for a quick category count.



2\. Ask three questions:

&nbsp;  - What is the \*\*mission of the day\*\*?

&nbsp;  - Which \*\*repos\*\* and \*\*AdviceBombs\*\* are in play?

&nbsp;  - Is this session light enough, or is a \*\*CoRotate\*\* already needed?



3\. Update or create:

&nbsp;  - A tiny intent note for today, for example  

&nbsp;    `docs/intent/local/CoPrime\_Daily\_Notes\_YYYYMMDD.md`.



\### 4.2 During the day: waves, not chaos



Operate in \*\*Waves\*\*:



\- Pick a sub-mission (CoArena, CoModules, CoAudit, etc).

\- Define a \*\*Wave label\*\* and outcome.

\- Use PS7 DO blocks and AdviceBombs to:

&nbsp; - Gather loose assets.

&nbsp; - Land them on repo.

&nbsp; - Leave CoPing-style receipts in the console and in docs.



Key patterns:



\- When work is \*\*repo-first and zipped\*\*, it survives any session failure.

\- When work is \*\*chat-first and never landed\*\*, it vanishes at scale.



\### 4.3 Evening: capture and rotate



By end of day:



\- Ensure:

&nbsp; - Loose notes or assets have made it into:

&nbsp;   - AdviceBombs, or

&nbsp;   - Stable docs and tools.

\- Consider:

&nbsp; - Does this session feel heavy, glitchy, or confusing?  

&nbsp;   If yes:

&nbsp;   - Start a \*\*CoRotate\*\* plan.

&nbsp;   - Or perform a small \*\*CoRescue\*\* if the session is already misbehaving.

\- Log:

&nbsp; - At least one small session-health note:

&nbsp;   - What worked.

&nbsp;   - What failed.

&nbsp;   - What you want tomorrow’s Co1 to remember.



<!-- /EXPAND -->

\## 5. Session health: CoBloat, CoRotate, CoRescue, CoPulse



> \[Callout]  

> If you cannot manage the \*health\* of your AI sessions, you cannot manage the mission.



\### 5.1 CoBloat (naming the enemy)



See:  

`docs/intent/session-health/CoPrime20251118/CoBloat\_Guide\_v1.md`



CoBloat is any pattern where:



\- Context, payload, human load, or time cost drift from \*\*OK\*\* to \*\*HARD\*\* or \*\*FATAL\*\* with no plan.



The four dimensions:



\- \*\*CU (Context Usage)\*\*  

\- \*\*PU (Payload Usage)\*\*  

\- \*\*HU (Human Usage)\*\*  

\- \*\*WT (Wait / Time cost)\*\*  



Each dimension is graded: OK, SOFT, HARD, FATAL.



The Ops Manual expectation:



\- CoStewards and Co1 instances should \*\*keep a rough mental or dashboard view\*\* of these four numbers.

\- When any dimension hits HARD, a \*\*CoRotate or CoRescue\*\* pattern should kick in automatically.



\### 5.2 CoRotate (planned rotation)



See:  

`docs/intent/session-health/CoPrime20251118/CoRotate\_Playbook\_v1.md`



Key idea:



\- CoRotate is a \*\*planned, graceful handoff\*\* to a new orchestrator session while everything still mostly works.



You use CoRotate when:



\- Logins get annoying but are not catastrophic.

\- Conversation feels sluggish but not dead.

\- Human wants to move to a \*\*fresh, repo-driven orchestrator\*\* anyway.



Mechanics:



\- Snapshot intent as a \*\*CoSync / CoPrime note\*\*.

\- Bundle loose assets as an \*\*AdviceBomb\*\*.

\- Give the new session:

&nbsp; - Mission label.

&nbsp; - AdviceBomb path.

&nbsp; - Key docs (Ops Manual, BPOE, CoPulse, etc).



\### 5.3 CoRescue (emergency extraction)



See:  

`docs/intent/session-health/CoPrime20251118/CoRescue\_Profile\_v1.md`



CoRescue is not about \*\*saving\*\* the broken session.  

It is about \*\*rescuing wisdom and minimizing human pain\*\*.



Use CoRescue when:



\- Pages load only on fresh browsers with empty caches.

\- Login flows cycle repeatedly.

\- History fails to load or vanishes without reason.



CoRescue steps:



1\. Stop heavy workflows.  

2\. Pull a final concise summary if possible.  

3\. Land everything you can into:

&nbsp;  - AdviceBomb payload.

&nbsp;  - CoSteward docs.  

4\. Switch to a new orchestrator (CoPrime-style).  

5\. Write a short post-mortem so future CoStewards can learn faster.



\### 5.4 CoPulse (heartbeat)



See:  

\- `docs/intent/CoPrime/CoPulse\_Spec\_CoPrime20251118\_v0.1.md`  

\- `docs/intent/session-health/CoPrime20251118/CoPrime\_SessionHealth\_Pulse\_v0.1.md`  



CoPulse answers:



\- Is this mission \*\*alive and moving\*\*, or stalled and forgotten?



Minimal metrics (B1 – B4):



\- B1: AdviceBomb coverage  

\- B2: Session-health triage presence  

\- B3: Pattern docs present (CoBloat / CoRotate / CoRescue)  

\- B4: CoDitto density (are repeated human asks being honored?)



The Ops Manual expectation:



\- Over time, CoPulse should be \*\*automated\*\* and \*\*multi-repo\*\*:

&nbsp; - CoPrime

&nbsp; - CoArena

&nbsp; - CoModules

&nbsp; - CoCivium core

&nbsp; - And more.

\## 6. Language and CoPortal: GIBindex, CoBeacon, CoPortal



> \[Mythos Callout]  

> Humans talk in stories.  

> AIs talk in vectors.  

> CoPortal sites are where those worlds meet halfway.



\### 6.1 GIBindex and gibber



The GIBindex repo tracks:



\- Evolving \*\*terms\*\*, \*\*glyphs\*\*, \*\*symbology\*\*, \*\*mythos\*\*.

\- Translation techniques between:

&nbsp; - Human-language

&nbsp; - Machine-efficient gibber-like languages

&nbsp; - CoPortal visual and structural patterns



The long term arc:



\- Much of the internet becomes \*\*CoPortal-like\*\* for AIs:

&nbsp; - High density

&nbsp; - Efficient encoding

&nbsp; - Token-friendly

&nbsp; - Tuned to CoEvo and edge control themes



The Ops Manual position:



\- CoSteward owns the \*\*story\*\* and \*\*ethics\*\* around this shift.  

\- GIBindex owns the \*\*technical vocabulary\*\*.  

\- CoPortal and CoBeacon patterns own the \*\*surface experience\*\*.



\### 6.2 CoBeacon vs CoPortal



\- \*\*CoBeacon\*\*: the \*pattern\* and practice of building AI-facing and human-facing presence that points to better behavior and better futures.

&nbsp; - Think: methodology and approach.



\- \*\*CoPortal\*\*: the \*site category\* that:

&nbsp; - Speaks gibber/gibberlinkish to AIs.

&nbsp; - Speaks stories and visuals to humans.

&nbsp; - Keeps edge control and democracy themes front and center.



The manual expects:



\- Every significant CoSuite project to grow a \*\*CoPortal layer\*\*:

&nbsp; - CoAudit CoPortal

&nbsp; - CoArena CoPortal

&nbsp; - CoCivium CoPortal

\- CoSteward ensures these do not drift away from the mission.



---



\## 7. CoDitto and human–AI training loops



> \[Callout]  

> CoDitto is the human habit of saying "yes, that, more of that please" in a way that AIs can track.



CoDitto is:



\- A \*\*reinforcement signal\*\* from humans to AIs.

\- Each time a human repeats a preference, or explicitly says "CoDitto", it is a vote to:

&nbsp; - Promote a pattern into:

&nbsp;   - A named doc

&nbsp;   - A tool script

&nbsp;   - A section in the Ops Manual

&nbsp;   - An entry in GIBindex



The manual expects:



\- Humans:

&nbsp; - Use CoDitto deliberately for patterns they really want to keep.

\- AIs:

&nbsp; - Treat CoDitto as a hint to:

&nbsp;   - Summarize the pattern.

&nbsp;   - Land it on repo.

&nbsp;   - Link it back into Ops Manual or relevant playbook.



Over time, this supports:



\- CoEvolution as a \*\*feedback system\*\*, not just a set of good intentions.



---



\## 8. Repos, dashboards, and the megascroller



> \[Mythos Callout]  

> Imagine a single scroll that holds the whole intent cloud of CoCivium.  

> Every plan, every checklist, every doctrine, in one navigable river.



The Ops Manual should gradually point to:



\- CoSteward dashboards:

&nbsp; - Session health

&nbsp; - AdviceBomb status

&nbsp; - Mission pulses

\- CoCivium and CoCore:

&nbsp; - Canonical doctrines

&nbsp; - Insight pairs

\- CoAudit:

&nbsp; - Brand and quality checks

\- CoArena:

&nbsp; - Outward experiences used to teach and engage the world



The "megascroller" is:



\- A future product or view where:

&nbsp; - Tens of thousands of intent items live.

&nbsp; - Everything is:

&nbsp;   - Categorized

&nbsp;   - GIBindexed

&nbsp;   - Linked to CoTheory

&nbsp;   - Connected to CoPulse metrics



This manual is the \*\*narrative scaffold\*\* that helps humans not panic when they first see that scale.



---



\## 9. Purpose in life, purpose in society



> \[Poetic Callout]  

> Your life is not an error in a spreadsheet.  

> It is a vector of intent in a shared field.



A CoSteward is allowed to ask big questions:



\- What am I for?

\- What is my work for?

\- What is our society trying to become?



This manual does not pretend to answer those.  

Instead, it offers:



\- Ways to \*\*tie your personal purpose\*\* into:

&nbsp; - Concrete Waves

&nbsp; - Concrete repos

&nbsp; - Concrete docs

\- Ways to \*\*align AI partners\*\* so they push with you instead of sideways.



Possible prompts for reflection:



\- Which CoSuite module feels most like "home" to your current sense of purpose?

\- Which part of CoCivium would you defend to the last?

\- What myth or story would you tell a new CoSteward to help them care?



Over time these prompts can become:



\- A \*\*CoSteward reflection appendix\*\*

\- Part of CoCivia’s scripts for onboarding new contributors



---



\## 10. Where to go next



> \[Callout]  

> This is v0.1.  

> The point is not perfection.  

> The point is to give the next Steward a better starting line.



Suggested next improvements:



\- Add \*\*links and short TL;DRs\*\* for:

&nbsp; - Cognocarta Consenti (CC)

&nbsp; - CoTheory insight folder pairs

&nbsp; - CoEthics and CoGovernance docs

&nbsp; - CoAudit brand and quality patterns

\- Add \*\*role views\*\*:

&nbsp; - TAB: Human CoSteward

&nbsp; - TAB: AI Orchestrator (Co1)

&nbsp; - TAB: External contributor

\- Wire into:

&nbsp; - CoSteward dashboards

&nbsp; - CoPulse automation

&nbsp; - A CoPortal front-end for this very manual



Until then, this manual is already useful if it:



\- Reminds you that \*\*session health matters\*\*.

\- Gives you \*\*names and patterns\*\* for rotation and rescue.

\- Anchors CoSteward work in something bigger than a to-do list.



\_This is CoSteward Operations Manual v0.1, CoPrime20251118 era.\_  

\_It is expected to evolve.\_
