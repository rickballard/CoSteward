# MegaWave Ops Docs (CoSteward)

This folder contains **operational docs** for running CoSuite sessions in a **MegaWave‑first** way.

- `CoPrime_SessionPlan_MegaWaves_v0.md`  
  Session‑plan extension describing how to:
  - maintain a MegaWave backlog,
  - track a per‑session MegaWave countdown,
  - record per‑wave receipts and FixWaves,
  - and hand off cleanly to Co1 / CoPrime / future sessions.

These docs are intended to complement existing BPOE material such as:

- CoSuite‑wide MegaWave BPOE
- CoStatus BPOE
- IntentCloud / CoPrime IntentCloud snapshot docs

Over time, Co1 / CoPrime can:
- promote this to a v1+ standard,
- merge with a unified session‑plan template,
- and keep this folder as the **hub** for MegaWave operational patterns.
