# CoSuite Current Repos (v1)

> Canonical list of CoSuite repos used by CoPrime / CoArena / CoAudit sessions.  
> This is a *starting surface*, not a full map.

- **CoCache**   — Advice bombs, inboxes, CoSync receipts, BPOE imports.
- **CoCivium**  — Civic / constitutional / BPOE / diagrams / sites.
- **CoSteward** — Personal ops, CoStatus, session notes, operator guides.
- **CoAgent**   — Multi-panel agent / container product.
- **CoArena**   — Arena / game-mode surface for CoAgent.
- **CoContrib** — Contributor onboarding, starter packs, contributor docs.
- **CoPolitic** — CoPolitic surface, thinker maps, perspective plane, etc.
- **CoCore**    — Core best-practice, CoNeura / CoDendra / CoAxa / etc.
- **CoAudit**   — CoAudit flows, guardrails, rails for CI and processes.
- **CoFlow**    — Pipelines, orchestration, flow-level rails.
- **CoRef**     — References, cross-links, canonical external sources.
- **CoCivia**   — CoCivAI / CoCivia club, AI-facing ecosystem docs.
- *(plus any new repos as they are created)*

## Expectations for sessions

- A CoPrime / CoArena session should **treat this document as the canonical map**
  of “where to look first” across the CoSuite.
- CoSync notes and MegaWave READMEs should reference this file instead of
  rebuilding the full list of repos in every conversation.

## MegaWave & Bootstrap BPOE (for all sessions)

- **MegaWave default**

  All non-trivial cycles MUST follow:

  - `docs/ops/MegaWave/CoSuite_BPOE_MegaWavePattern_v1.md`

- **Repo surface**

  Sessions SHOULD treat:

  - `docs/ops/MegaWave/CoSuite_CurrentRepos_v1.md`

  as the canonical map of CoSuite repos.

- **Session obligations**

  For each cycle:

  - Short commentary on last cycle,
  - Clear intent for this cycle,
  - At least one CoBlock that builds a MegaWave zip *or* script + SHA256,
  - A CoPing line at the end.

  Heavy work must be in PS7 scripts and markdown files, not in the chat body.
