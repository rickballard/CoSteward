# CoSuite Repo Inventory and Rehome Plan v0.1

Mission label: CoPrime20251118

This file is the starting point for:
- Understanding which repos exist.
- Assigning each repo a clear role.
- Identifying under-used / legacy / misnamed repos for rehome or merge.

## 1. Role categories

- **Core**: Absolutely central to CoCivium / CoSuite.
- **Orbital**: Important, but can be swapped or paused without killing the mission.
- **Sandbox**: Experiments, prototypes, spikes.
- **Legacy / Depr**: Old shapes that should be archived or merged.
- **To-Merge / To-Rehome**: Repos that should be absorbed into a better home.

## 2. Initial table (seed)

| Repo              | Status   | Role category | Primary mission                               | Notes / rehome ideas                    |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| CoCivium          | Active   | Core          | Shared doctrines, insights, CoPortal layer    | Home of doctrines + insights pairs      |
| CoSteward         | Active   | Core          | Ops manual, dashboards, BPOE, CoPulse, CoBloat| CoSteward Ops Manual + session health   |
| CoAgent           | Active   | Core          | Orchestrator / 4-panel tooling                | Future commercial CoAgent / CoArena base|
| CoArena           | Active   | Orbital       | Productized, gamified CoAgent experiences     | Might host public demos                 |
| CoAudit           | Active   | Orbital       | Brand/quality checks, content sanity          | CoAudit advisory + dashboards           |
| CoModules         | Active   | Orbital       | Modular building blocks / components          | Candidate home for reusable CoBlocks    |
| CoContrib         | Mixed    | Orbital       | Contributor onboarding and training           | May merge some guides into CoSteward    |
| CoPolitic         | Mixed    | Orbital       | Public-facing civic / sponsor messaging       | Needs alignment with CoPortal patterns  |
| RickPublic        | Active   | Orbital       | Rick’s public-facing writing / Substack bridge| Tie into CoPortal + CoBeacon            |
| InSeed            | Active   | Orbital       | Consulting and services framing               | Bridge between InSeed and CoCivium      |
| (other repos...)  | Unknown  | Sandbox?      |                                               | To be classified                        |

## 3. Rehome principles

- If a repo is:
  - rarely used,
  - overlapping in purpose,
  - or mostly doctrinal,
  then:
  - prefer moving doctrine into **CoCivium/docs/doctrine** or **docs/insights/...**,
  - and keeping the repo as Sandbox / Legacy until migration is complete.

- If a repo is:
  - ops / process related,
  then:
  - prefer moving core patterns into **CoSteward/docs/ops**,
  - linking from the CoSteward Ops Manual.

- If a repo is:
  - mostly an interface layer (site, UI, portal),
  then:
  - classify it as part of the **CoPortal / CoBeacon** ecosystem,
  - and ensure its purpose is clear in this inventory.

## 4. Next passes

- Add all local Co* repos found under `~/Documents/GitHub`.
- For each:
  - Set Status (Active, Paused, Legacy).
  - Set Role category.
  - Add at least one line of Notes / rehome ideas.

Over time this doc should:
- Drive PRs that rename / merge / archive repos.
- Serve as the "map" for any new CoSteward or Co1 instance that wants to understand the repo landscape quickly.
