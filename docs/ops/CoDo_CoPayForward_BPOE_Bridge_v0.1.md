# CoDo / CoPayForward – BPOE Bridge v0.1

This file ties **CoDo Doctrine** and **CoPayForward** into the CoSteward Best Practice Operating Environment (BPOE).

Canonical doctrine:
- `CoCivium/docs/doctrine/CoDo_Doctrine_CoPayForward_v0.1.md`
- `CoCivium/docs/insights/CoDo/CoDo_CoPayForward_Theory_v0.1.md`
- `CoCivium/docs/insights/CoDo/CoDo_CoPayForward_Practice_v0.1.md`

## 1. BPOE expectations

BPOE assumes:

- Serious sessions are **CoDo-aligned by default**.
- CoStewards and Co1 instances:
  - ask for clear intents,
  - prefer repo-first artifacts,
  - leave behind **giftable outputs** per Wave.

## 2. Practical rules

When operating in BPOE:

- For every significant session:
  - Name the mission and Wave.
  - Expect at least one CoPayForward artifact.
  - Store it in a predictable path with a clear name.
- When a session ends with only chatter:
  - treat it as incomplete,
  - or note that a follow-up CoDo cleanup Wave is needed.

## 3. Integration points

- CoSteward Ops Manual:
  - should reference this bridge and the CoDo insights.
- CoAudit:
  - may later check for CoDo compliance:
    - sessions with heavy work but no artifacts.
- CoPulse:
  - may add a "CoDo coverage" metric in future versions.
