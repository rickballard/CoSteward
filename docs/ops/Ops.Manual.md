## Canonical CoTip — Type in PS7, not chat
- Prefer PS7/CLI for long instructions; it reduces lag-induced typos and prevents accidental term invention.
- Use CoPing anchors: say the block title, say “and”, repeat the title when pasting.
- Expect repackaging: AIs confirm and may adjust/overrule for global BPOEs and dedupe/orphan sweeps.
