# CoFace Style Meta – Theory v0.1

CoFace is the pattern for describing the *face* an asset shows to humans.

It exists because:

- Human facing assets carry:
  - Mythos
  - Emotion
  - Story
  - Identity
- AI refactors tend to:
  - Normalize tone
  - Strip unusual formatting
  - Collapse story and doctrine into neutral script

Without CoFace, future editors and AIs:

- Cannot see which assets are:
  - High HumanTouch
  - High congruence (c-score)
  - Canonical for human culture, not just for models
- May flatten:
  - Emotive framings
  - Mythos callouts
  - Gibber embellishments
  - CoStory and CoMeta subtleties

CoFace says:

- "This asset has a *job* in the emotional and cultural field, not just in the concept graph."
- "Do not optimize it solely for token efficiency or machine readability."

In the long arc:

- CoFace will:
  - Anchor HumanTouch metrics
  - Interact with GIBindex entries
  - Inform CoAudit brand and quality checks
  - Help CoPortal and CoBeacon decide what to surface first to humans
