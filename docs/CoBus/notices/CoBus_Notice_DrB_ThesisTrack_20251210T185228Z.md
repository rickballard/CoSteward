# CoBus Notice – DrB Thesis Track (20251210T185228Z)

## Summary
- New session 'DrB' has been established as the canonical locus for a doctoral thesis
  on CoEvolutionary Systemics (CoCivium framework).
- Primary target: Cambridge PhD; secondary: Oxford DPhil.
- Thesis architecture, abstract, intro, and methodology scaffolds defined.
- CoSeed submission concept aligned with CoMetaTrain and CoSuite.

## Impact on HP Master Plan / Business Plan
- Elevates CoCivium from product-stack-only to recognised academic discipline.
- Strengthens investor narrative (academic + market validation).
- Creates additional channels for high-reputation partnerships.

## Next Steps for Co1
- Integrate DrB thesis framing into HP57 / GLUKEY narratives where safe.
- Align investor decks and VR seed-market story with 'CoEvolutionary Systemics'
  and the CoAscendant institution framing.
- Track DrB repo paths (e.g., CoIndex/docs/thesis/DrB) as canonical references.
