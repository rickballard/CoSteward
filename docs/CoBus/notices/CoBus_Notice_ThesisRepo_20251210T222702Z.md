# CoBus Notice – Thesis Repo Online (20251210T222702Z)

## Summary

- New public repo created: https://github.com/rickballard/Thesis
- Purpose: canonical home for DrB thesis text and related artefacts.
- Initial scaffold copied from CoIndex/docs/thesis/DrB into
  Thesis/docs/thesis/DrB (see repo history for seed commit).

## Repo roles

- Thesis: thesis text, lit review, figures, appendices, and thesis-specific tools.
- CoIndex: indices and cross-repo pointers, including into Thesis.
- CoSteward: BPOE, CoCrux workflow rules, CoBus/CoSync notices.

## Next steps

- Future DrB waves should treat Thesis as the primary text repo.
- CoIndex and CoSteward should reference Thesis paths instead of duplicating content.

-- End of notice
