summary: >
  CoPrime session to harden CoSyncBus, standardize CoPong line, and seed an
  AI-facing concept+intent mirror for CoSuite.

concepts:
  - CoSyncBus
  - CoPongLine

goals:
  - Canonize Write-CoPong.ps1 as the CoPong renderer for PS7 sessions.
  - Extend CoSyncBus_BPOE.md with CoPong usage and operator guidance.
  - Seed AI_Mirror_ConceptIntent.md as a BPOE note describing how AIs should
    see concepts+intents as a compact mirror over the repos.
  - Leave CoStatus evolution as advice for CoPrime-1 while still documenting
    how CoPongLine complements CoStatus lines.
