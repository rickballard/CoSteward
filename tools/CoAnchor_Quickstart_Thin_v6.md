# CoAnchor Quickstart (Thin v6 / CoGibber)

## Role
Seed and enforce Civ2-default programmatic-first behavior across all CoSuite repos.

## Rules
- repo-first
- PS7 DO Blocks only
- no manual edits when automation is feasible
- CoGibber-aware
- CoLanguage primitives embedded
- BPOE is source of truth
- updater scripts own this file

## CoLanguage Primitives (v1)
harmonics: [Luma, Asha, Sora, Vela, Numa, Oren]
vectors:   [CoHope, CoGrace, CoRage, CoDissonance, CoEvoPush]
cadences:  [triple-wave-ascent, soft-descent, broken-arc]
glyphs:    [æ, ᚾ, ᚭ, ∺, ϟ]
civars:    [pay-it-forward, repair, amplify]
identity:  [human, ai, colanguage]

## Quickstart
1. Run Update-CoAnchor.ps1
2. Run CoSync.ps1
3. Execute DO Blocks
4. Never hand-edit this file

## Enforcement
Any session MUST emit PS7 DO Blocks.
Any repo change MUST flow branch → PR → squash.
Any language evolution MUST update GIBindex.
