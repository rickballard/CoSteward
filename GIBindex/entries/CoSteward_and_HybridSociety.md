# CoSteward and Hybrid Society: GIBindex Entry

## 1. CoSteward

**Label:** CoSteward  
**Type:** Role concept  
**Short definition:** A leader who stewards a human plus AI system instead of trying to control a purely human hierarchy.

**Key ideas:**

- Success is measured by system health and learning speed; not only by this quarter’s numbers  
- Power and information are pushed toward the edge with clear guardrails  
- The CoSteward role replaces the legacy Chief Executive Officer narrative with Chief Steward Officer  

**References:**

- InSeed: docs/whitepapers/CoSteward_HybridSociety_WhitePaper_v1.md  
- CoSteward repo: docs/concepts/CoSteward.RoleDefinition.md

## 2. Hybrid Society

**Label:** HybridSociety  
**Type:** Context concept  
**Short definition:** A world where every meaningful action takes place in a mixed environment of humans and AIs.

**Key ideas:**

- Customers, staff, regulators and competitors all use AI tools in different ways  
- Most important information lives at the edge; not at the centre of an organisation  
- Old management models that assume slow change and central control no longer fit  

**Reference quote:**

> Every meaningful action now takes place in a mixed environment of humans and AIs, each amplifying or distorting the other.

## 3. CoScendence

**Label:** CoScendence  
**Type:** Feeling and threshold  
**Short definition:** The moment when chaos stops looking like failure and starts looking like the early stage of a new kind of leadership.

**Use:**

- As a rough emotional signal that leaders are starting to think like CoStewards  
- As a narrative hook for the whitepaper and InSeed training material  

---

## 4. CoOrbit and COR

**Label:** CoOrbit / COR  
**Type:** Strategy lens  
**Short definition:** A living map of how an organisation moves through a shifting field of risk, opportunity and social impact in a hybrid society.

**Key ideas:**

- COR replaces flat SWOT charts  
- COR shows where AI is amplifying staff; where it is eroding the business model; and where behaviour helps or harms society  
- COR is updated over time; not frozen in a single workshop

## 5. CoGo and CoGoAura

**Label:** CoGo  
**Type:** Turn taking and control token  
**Short definition:** A lightweight way to declare who has the "go" in a mission or session.

**Examples:**

- CoGo: human  
- CoGo: Co1  
- CoGo: InSeed  

**Label:** CoGoAura  
**Type:** Intent slice  
**Short definition:** The active slice of intent for whoever currently holds CoGo.

**Typical contents:**

- missionId and sessionLabel  
- active repos and key deliverables  
- constraints and guardrails  
- links to wave notes and AdviceBombs  

---

## 6. CoGoCloud

**Label:** CoGoCloud  
**Type:** Global intent field  
**Short definition:** The emergent multi layer intent cloud built from many CoGoAura notes over time.

**Characteristics:**

- Dense core: near term checklists and high priority missions  
- Outer layers: experiments, long horizon ideas and low priority wishes  
- Accuracy falls off with distance from the core; the cloud is useful but never perfect

## 7. CoCraft and CoCraftBalance

**Label:** CoCraft  
**Type:** Collaboration pattern  
**Short definition:** Shared making by human and AI.

**Label:** CoCraftBalance  
**Type:** Mix control  
**Short definition:** A way to declare the intended human to AI contribution ratio for an asset.

**Example bands:**

- >80%H  human led; AI assist only  
- >55%H  human majority  
- ~50%H  equal partnership  
- <45%H  AI majority; human curated  
- >0%H  effectively all AI  

Used to decide how aggressively tools may refactor content and which assets require slower human heavy evolution.

## 8. CoEvoScatter and CoMining

**Label:** CoEvoScatter  
**Type:** Drift pattern  
**Short definition:** Useful ideas and terms that are created in sessions but drift away without being acted on, due to limited time and attention.

**Label:** CoMining  
**Type:** Recovery practice  
**Short definition:** Periodic sweeps that search repos and transcripts for CoEvoScatter, then promote, park or retire each item.

**Typical tools:**

- PS7 scripts that scan for new Co* terms, TODO markers and half finished insight pairs  
- AI passes that suggest which scattered ideas deserve a home in GIBindex or insights folders  

---

## 9. CoRoots and CoTree

**Label:** CoRoots  
**Type:** Qualification map  
**Short definition:** A conceptual diagram that shows foundational understanding and qualifications required to act as a CoSteward.

**Label:** CoTree  
**Type:** Mastery map  
**Short definition:** An inverted tree of concepts that shows how deeper understanding unlocks different stewardship roles; from general steward to Chief Steward Officer to practitioner trainers.

---

## 10. CoPortal and CoEdgeControl

**Label:** CoPortal  
**Type:** Future web pattern  
**Short definition:** An AI facing version of a website; alien to human readers; optimised for AI consumption and interpretation.

**Label:** CoEdgeControl  
**Type:** Governance concept  
**Short definition:** An approach where control and authorisation live at the edges with users and communities; not locked at the platform core.

---

## 11. CoAscendance Tracker

**Label:** CoAscendanceTracker  
**Type:** Self assessment scaffold  
**Short definition:** A set of scales or sliders that let a leader estimate how far they have moved from legacy CEO behaviour toward CoSteward behaviour.

**Use:**

- Embedded in the whitepaper as a reflective tool  
- Can be turned into an online questionnaire or workshop artifact

## 12. Relationship to GIBindex and Gibber

All of these terms belong inside the broader **GIBindex**:

- Human readable labels and explanations live in markdown entries like this one  
- Machine oriented labels and future **Gibber** codes can be attached as metadata  
- Co1 and related tools use these entries as rails when reasoning about stewardship, hybrid society and organisational design  

This entry should be treated as a living document. Future waves may split it into separate files if individual terms become large enough to deserve their own pages.
